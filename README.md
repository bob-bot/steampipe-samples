## github-external-contributor-analysis

[This folder](./github-external-contributor-analysis/README.md) has the SQL script we used to produce In [A portrait of VSCode's external contributors](https://steampipe.io/blog/vscode-analysis), along with a tool that builds versions of that script for other GitHub repos.
