services.<p>As a regular sea swimmer I read this HN submission with interest [1]
and after a deep dig into the document and links I decided to take
some action. Some nasty rip currents have appeared at my local beach,
popular with tourists with children. Due to reduced maintenance, sand
bars have built up during the past two pandemic years which people
seem unaware of. There are no waring signs.<p>So I decided to contact my local council.<p>I compiled some detailed information with the GPS coordinates of
danger spots and a simple explanation to suggest temporary warning
signs this summer.  Each week they send me a local news letter, so I
decided to reply to that with my concerns.<p>&quot;This is a no reply address and is not monitored&quot;<p>Fair enough? Not really. In my opinion that&#x27;s just bloody rude and
lazy. But nevertheless, on to their web page...<p>They have a &quot;Beach Safety&quot; page. Hoorah. But without JavaScript their
pages render almost nothing. Okay, so this is important, time to put
my own cybersecurity at risk for the greater good and switch on
scripts.  Still, the page will not load due to external fonts
etc. Okay, time to throw my own privacy and dignity to the wind and
unblock all the tracking crap. There is a web link but it is obscured
by some bad style sheets that makes it disappear under another element.<p>I give up. Instead I will raise my concerns with the lifeguards, who
are probably aware but don&#x27;t have temporary signs to put up.<p>Visiting the RNLI site I am immediately thrown out.<p><pre><code>   &quot;Access denied Error code 1020

Hey thanks Cloudflare for helping save lives.<p>Let&#x27;s disable all privacy and security settings, change my web proxy,
and try again.<p>Beneath the stock images of smiling staff I eventually find a well
buried web form that wants, my name, location, daytime telephone,
mobile telephone...<p>How very dare you! I am going out of my way, spending my own time to
help others, and you want to data-rape me as our first encounter. I
could fill it out with stubs and false info, but then risk some
regular-expression dropping my important message. And besides, why
should I feel forced to act like a criminal while attempting to help
others?<p>I give up on that line.<p>Not defeated, I look up their phone number in the plain old phone
book.  I call and speak to someone who takes my concerns seriously and
we manually note the locations of concern. She tells me all guards on
those beaches will be informed.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve spoken to people who cannot book doctors appointments or
speak to the police because they are deflected and re-routed to web
services that do not work.<p>Is the WWW finished as an informational format?<p>Is it being used as a way to dodge responsibility?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31814221",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Basically, an interface like Figma, but for interacting with different types of structured data. Think: web-ish interfaces for web-ish data on an infinite pannable, zoomable canvas.<p>Why? I&#x27;ve become incredibly bored with how homogenized the web has become, everything a neat, perfect grid. Moreover, I want to explore what might be possible in building interfaces outside of these repeatable patterns and paradigms.<p>I&#x27;m aware of a few react libraries for rendering to canvas such as react-konva, react-ape, etc. Most of what I&#x27;ve found are plugins for React itself.<p>That might be the right way to think about the problem, but it might not be. I&#x27;m at the earliest exploratory stage of this, so it&#x27;s worth questioning if React is the right abstraction for this in the first place.<p>Hence, is there something <i>like React</i> (but not React) for building these types of zoomable&#x2F;pannable interfaces?<p>OTOH, maybe React is the right abstraction, in which case, I&#x27;d love to hear anyone&#x27;s experiences building these types of interfaces.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
