31838476,Ask HN: How do I efficiently track record count for big (distributed) DBs?,2022-06-22T16:49:08Z,extra_rice,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve run in to this interesting question multiple times mostly during systems design interviews, but I&#x27;m never quite sure what&#x27;s the &quot;best&quot; way to address this since I&#x27;ve not encountered it in any of my real world projects, unfortunately. This is usually in the context of high demand items such as limited time promotional vouchers, concert tickets, limited stock items, etc. that customers will for sure be rushing to buy, and will sell out in a relatively short period of time.<p>My naive solution to this is to basically count the number of reservations made (basically, do something like an SQL count of all the rows) and subtract it from some constant limit, which can be safely copied across multiple instances of the reservation&#x2F;ticketing service. However, for millions of rows, this may be potentially slow and having to do this for thousands of requests per second could be fairly inefficient. Adding some caching in front of a (probably sharded&#x2F;distributed) database might help, but due to the numbers being updated very quickly, I&#x27;m not sure the cache will help that much.<p>One alternative I can think of is maybe setup a lightweight(?) store (something like Redis perhaps, though I don&#x27;t have first hand experience with it) to keep track of the count. This will introduce problems related to eventual consistency, but I think it could work. This can be durable store, or we can make it semi-durable and just do a count query if we ever need to restore the service. I always ask if it&#x27;s possible for us to handle overbooking because there&#x27;s a chance this could occur. Strong consistency guarantees will prevent this, but at the cost of slower performance.<p>Another alternative I can think of is adding a sequence number to the reservation records, and query the max instead. I&#x27;m not sure if this performs better than count or they&#x27;re pretty similar in performance.<p>Any insights or pointers on this?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We’re Jacqueline and Frank from Astro (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tryastro.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tryastro.com&#x2F;</a>). We’re a platform that gives you access to engineering talent in Latin America and lets you build teams there. We take care of the sourcing, payroll, HR, benefits, local procurement, and equipment, all from an easy-to-use dashboard. (Video here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RmiVOVfbHFI"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RmiVOVfbHFI</a>)<p>Before starting Astro, we worked as leaders at the same company, Jacqueline in sales and Frank in engineering. As we built our teams, we found it was very hard to compete against top tech companies for talent. Therefore, we broadened our search beyond Austin, Texas.<p>We ended up working with various partners in Latin America because of the strong talent pool, great English, and US friendly time zones. However, finding and retaining engineering teams in Latin America was a challenge. We loved our teammates, but were never thrilled about the outsourcing firms they worked for. Because they weren’t our employees, we couldn’t control what they were being paid, couldn’t give them benefits and perks, and the only visibility we had was the $150&#x2F;hr bill we got from the outsourcing company. How much of that actually went to the team?<p>Because traditional outsourcing firms tend to attract non-tech clients and their culture revolves around billable hours, our team members were also unsatisfied with the outsourcing company that they worked for. Freelancing could be an alternative, but is also difficult for teams in Latin America due to its inherent risk and likelihood of being treated as a second class contractor on a foreign team rather than a first-class stakeholder.<p>We were stuck with three uncomfortable options: outsource the entire product, manage a large team of independent freelancers, or rely on an outsourcing company to create our engineering culture.<p>What we really wanted were our own teams, including our own offices, equipment, salaries, benefits, etc. But setting up a foreign entity and knowing how to hire in foreign markets was a distraction and difficult—not to mention payroll, benefits, procurement, legal compliance, etc.<p>We ultimately went to work at different companies, but continued to experience the same pain points at our new companies. Finally, in 2018, after commiserating many times over beers, we decided to build the company we kept looking for, a company to automatically handle all of these international complexities.<p>We originally called ourselves Austin Software and we started by building teams by hand for startups in Austin, Texas. Then, we started to realize we had gotten good at solving lots of problems on behalf of teams in the US: sourcing Macbooks, finding competitive local benefits and perks, legal compliance, even organizing happy hours, travel and SWAG. Our idea was to productize what we’d learned and make it available to other companies. We got tired of explaining that we build teams, not bill project hours! So we built Astro (“Austin Software Tool for Recommendations and Opportunities” :)<p>You can think of Astro as something like a love child between Toptal + Gusto + WeWork + Amazon (the latter because of the logistics we do — more on that below), tailored specifically for software engineering teams in LATAM. Unlike Toptal or Turing, we fulfill local benefits, equipment, even team-building events. Our pricing is also transparent, in contrast to companies that charge by the hour, upfront fees, or handcuff you to long-term contracts. Customers review and pay for 1) the developer’s desired salary, 2) benefits and taxes, and 3) our 15% management fee on a week-to-week basis.<p>Here’s one example of the kind of thing we take care of. A 16 inch M1 Macbook Pro is not just a perk in Latin America, they actually save countless hours when dealing with heavy dev environments. But they’re difficult to source in Latin America, especially outside of the handful of major cities. And even if they are sourced, they’re extremely expensive, especially if they know you’re an American company, and getting them to teammates across South America runs the risk of theft or damage. We solve this by having local entities, local logistics, local distribution and secure local offices.<p>We’re proud of the fact that developers in Latin America have a much better experience working with us. That’s because our customers (i.e. the companies using Astro) are looking to scale their engineering departments with long-term stakeholders, not temporary “horsepower”, and also because real tech culture (the sort of thing devs in Silicon Valley take for granted) is a huge draw for developers, but nearly impossible to find via outsourcing shops, and very hit-and-miss on Toptal&#x2F;Turing.<p>We hope you’ll try us out! Visit <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.TryAstro.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.TryAstro.com</a>, and configure your desired team (See video tutorial and screenshots below if you&#x27;re just curious). Astro will source, pre-vet, schedule interviews, send offer letters, manage employment contracts, and coordinate equipment, office space, and SWAG. Once that’s set up, you can use Astro to manage your team on an ongoing basis: salaries, bonuses, additional benefits, perks, equipment, etc.<p>Check out some screenshots here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;folders&#x2F;17qYsZLKrhPdE1Ud1LA5A8RYNZiJkXo41"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;folders&#x2F;17qYsZLKrhPdE1Ud1LA5A...</a> and a video tutorial here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RmiVOVfbHFI"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RmiVOVfbHFI</a><p>We’d love to hear your feedback and we’re excited to answer any questions!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

My political angst stems from mismanagement of state coffers rather than social issues.<p>I am risk averse and this too reflects in every aspect of my life..not just money. Although I can’t be accused of being ‘penny wise pound foolish’, I will walk away from adrenaline rush hooks. So I almost wear it like a badge of merit. Like it’s a secret I brought to this country and that I share with other immigrants.<p>Until it just struck me today..perhaps Americans ‘live pay check to pay check’ because they never had to save. Saving is an off shoot from uncertainty and instability. India when I was growing up was not a bed of political and economic stability. Even though we were comfortably middle class, the national anxiety seeps into homes. We also saw this here recently during the great covid toilet paper scarcity and hoarding phenomena.<p>Citizens of wealthy nations don’t save because they don’t have to as there is sufficient trust in the government. Saving is a reaction to scarcity.<p>I stopped saving a while ago, but now watching the interest rate goat rodeo, I have started thinking about it again.<p>Curious about other saving philosophies and how the latest bank shenanigans will influence ingrained stances about money at every level.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

31838895,Ask HN: How do you establish trust with strangers?,2022-06-22T17:16:01Z,tonymet,6,false,false,1,[31839191],<null>,<null>,<null>,"While home-buying I was bombarded with dozens of introductions to strangers asking me to wire large sums of money and share sensitive personal information, typically via email.  The emails themselves were suspicious – from dubious domains, lacking signatures – few if any signals to trust the individual.<p>To establish trust I asked them to Facetime and share IDs mutually, but they balked.  I&#x27;ve tried this before and people are generally reluctant.  Asking for a mutual phone call with a trusted person was also met with suspicion.<p>Ultimately, I met the escrow agents and sellers face-to-face at their business to collect business cards and transfer information.  There&#x27;s still no better authentication than meeting a person at their place of business: they have business cards, an office, co-workers – half a dozen signals to verify identity.<p>Despite the high incidence of wire fraud and identity theft, authentication protocols are all one-sided.  Customers require credentials but there&#x27;s no way to authenticate the business agents. This goes beyond banking to include healthcare, utilities, credit bureaus, the tax industry – any business relationship that  shares sensitive or personal info.<p><i>tl;dr</i> :<p>So, how do you go about establishing trust with strangers in order to share sensitive information or transfer money? What process and &#x2F; or tech do you use to identify &amp; trust the other side of the transaction?<p><i>My Proposal</i> :<p>On the social side, we need to improve the culture of verifying identity to encourage a mutual process.  Both sides need to share IDs and proofs of identity for any transaction to be sound.<p>As for technology, we need better systems to empower customers to validate the authenticity of agents, including one-time tokens and business verification.  A system like &quot;The Work Number&quot;, used for employee verification, could be effective to validate business agents without compromising them. These systems need to be stable over legacy channels like phone, fax, wire transfers, paper checks &amp; email – systems that will remain for 30+ years.<p>As software engineers we need to establish trust mutually and give more attention to the business-side of the trust relationship.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
