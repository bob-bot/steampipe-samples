In my case, I&#x27;m facing a bit of a struggle reproducing them - *most of our classifications are derived from the diaphragm, instead of regions within the lung*. Curiously, we are attaining a reasonable AUROC, with .773 on training and .749 on validation data - the paper reports .8062 AUROC.<p>My current model is being trained on a subsample of the main dataset, and I&#x27;m basically looking to this as a way to validate the architecture.
