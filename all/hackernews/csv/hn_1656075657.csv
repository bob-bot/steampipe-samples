However, I&#x27;ve been amazed to find out how much my aerobic fitness has cratered over the last couple years of working at home (no more cycling to work) and I&#x27;m unable to train for the required 3-4 hours per week at low intensities because I&#x27;m so aerobically unfit and muscularly weak. 
I see this as me passing a unit test (able to run 5k at intensity) but failing an integration&#x2F;performance test (unable to string together long periods of training). 
Bringing this into sharper focus is that I&#x27;ve learned that this exact amount of training (3-4 hours of zone 2 training per week according to Peter Attia) is the recommended dose of exercise for a long health span, making me wonder what other aspects of my life are quietly failing due to me not having a test and benchmark to measure against.<p>Would love to hear of various objectiv-ish ways to evaluate a person&#x27;s abilities in important aspects of life: fitness&#x2F;health&#x2F;strength, finances, mental health, relationships.
I&#x27;m not looking for 100% test coverage here, this is merely an attempt to catalogue the important parts of our life and the ways to observe them over the long term.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
