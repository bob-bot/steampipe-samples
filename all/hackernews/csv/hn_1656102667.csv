31868770,Ask HN: Can a politically exposed person in middle age become a CS researcher?,2022-06-24T20:19:24Z,cs137,1,false,false,1,[31868904],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve been a programmer for about 20 years. I&#x27;ve long since outgrown business programming, but I also didn&#x27;t like being a manager very much. As I wrap up a couple other projects, I&#x27;m pursuing a master&#x27;s degree. So far, I enjoy it a lot and I&#x27;m doing well. I think I&#x27;d like to continue for a PhD, and see what lies beyond that.<p>My problems are twofold. One is age. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m too old to get into a PhD program, but by the time I would complete one, I&#x27;ll be, best-case scenario, in my mid-40s. I don&#x27;t think should matter at all, because what matters is how many productive years a person has left--a highly variable unknown, with a median low enough that my age is a complete non-issue--but, of course, I don&#x27;t control perceptions. There is a possibility that getting a PhD will only make me more overqualified and unemployable than I already am.<p>The second issue is that I&#x27;m a politically exposed person. The less said about that, the better, but I&#x27;ve publicly associated myself with the antifascism (&quot;antifa&quot;) movement, and I have exposed some truly bad actors in the tech industry. I have no regrets about this, but it turned out those bad actors had friends. Whoops. I&#x27;m sure my real name would mean absolutely nothing to the younger crowd, but I&#x27;ve made enemies in high places (and suffered death threats, rescinded job offers, rumor campaigns, you name it). At one point, I got a warning from a federal agency not to go to San Francisco for a talk I was going to give, because it would put my life in danger. I will never be able to get a job (or, in an academic context, a grant) from any of the FAANGs. (I&#x27;m mostly okay with, because I dislike those companies). I have no small number of permanent enemies who will never forgive me.<p>At some point, it became clear that the decent jobs in the tech industry were no longer (and would never be) available to me. Political exposure cools off over time; however, the issue of age goes the other way. My fear is that, research being more competitive, this political exposure might be a permanent blocker, or at least an issue for long enough that it would, say, complicate a job search five years from now in a competitive field.<p>Does anyone familiar with computer science research (inside or outside of academia) have enough experience to have an informed opinion on this? I have worked in (mostly private-sector) research before, so I know what I&#x27;m getting into in terms of the work itself. What I don&#x27;t know is whether age and political exposure, given the hypercompetitive nature of the research job market, are insurmountable obstacles. I may have to change countries, which is of course another thing I am looking into.<p>Thanks in advance for your help.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
