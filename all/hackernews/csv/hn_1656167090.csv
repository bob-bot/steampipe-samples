This is why I started indexed_bzip2. It is a header-only C++ library with Python bindings so that I can use it as a backend from ratarmount. For that, it also supports working with Python file-like objects by using the Python API.<p>For this project, I started with the super-permissively 0-BSD licensed and small bzip2 decoder from the toybox project and extracted what I needed from it.
The architecture for the parallel decoding plus random seeking took me some iterations and contemplation to get right.
It uses block-based caching and prefetching to achieve both of these things.
&quot;Right&quot; means that it is modular enough that I can reason about it and be convinced that it is correct.
Of course, there are also a lot of automated tests with all kinds of sanitizers to check for correctness because I am wary when it comes to reading user data.<p>All in all, this project was a nice brainteaser with which I could grow and I think it is largely finished for now.
The single-core bzip2 decoder might profit from further optimizations but it already outperforms the internal Python bz2 module for 2 cores and more.
And it also outperforms the internal Python bz2 module when it comes to random access because it is in constant time with indexed_bzip2.
All this comes at the cost of higher memory usage (for the block cache), though.
Currently, I&#x27;m trying to reuse the infrastructure I built for this to implement parallel random access to gzip files for usage in ratarmount but I&#x27;m not sure when that will be finished.",story,https://github.com/mxmlnkn/indexed_bzip2,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
