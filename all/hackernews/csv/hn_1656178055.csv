We are still able to raise, but much less, let&#x27;s say &lt; 10 millions $ but for the same dilution.<p>So it was decided to layoff people, even if we are already understaffed, because founders don&#x27;t want to dilute that much for so little money. Founders want to increase company runaway to last until end of next year, in order to let us time to have better numbers to show and hope that the economical context will be more favorable to them to raise money.<p>So my question is, is there a downside, beside for founders and dilution, to make a Serie A at such a low lvl ?
What are the consequences&#x2F;downside if we decide to take the money even if it is not at our best advantage ?<p>Thanks for your knowledge&#x2F;answer :)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I was thinking of letting others use it, but what if it&#x27;s not secure enough? What if people use it and something happens, would I be in hot water?<p>Once I develop the project enough, I do plan to make it open source, and only after that I would launch. At least that&#x27;s the plan. I was wondering how to do good enough security audits on your own when the software is finally built.
