It’s various credit cards or small loans with the usual companies we all get junk mail from.<p>My credit is fine, other than just the high balances bringing the score down.<p>Doing a refi or HELOC isn’t an option.<p>My specific questions:<p>Has anyone been through this and figured out a way to consolidate? Anyone find a loan company that is willing to consolidate, even if it’s a high interest rate? I’m basically treading water and not making a dent at anything. Consolidating and getting it somewhat more manageable would help.<p>Haven&#x27;t had any luck with LendingTree, SoFi, etc. despite their advertisements. I could give them a try again though.<p>Anyone have luck negotiating down balances?<p>Looking for a company that understands the situation and not just running a credit report and denying it.
