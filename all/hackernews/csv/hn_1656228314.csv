(iirc reading an article on a hash collision in GH a few years ago here on ycomb)<p>To my mind these orgs have to have a suite tools&#x2F;algos requesting information from multiple services, checking whether or not a hash has been taken â€“ and those processes have to optimize for time. (e.g. when a user makes a post, what&#x27;s a reasonable time to do a lookup?)<p>So, what are the considerations which need to be made algorithmically to check such collisions while keeping runtime to an acceptable minimum?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
