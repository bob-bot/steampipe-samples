31885991,Ask HN: Why can't the government forced standardized bottles and containers?,2022-06-26T17:34:56Z,samemail88,2,false,false,5,"[31886428,31886059,31886217,31886339,31886007]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"Climate change and environmentalism has been on my mind a lot lately and it&#x27;s got me thinking ways to solutions to tackle it. One solution I thought of is why can&#x27;t the US government force the standardization of bottles and containers. Imagine if the government create a standard for two types of bottles and containers; one for consumables (drinks, etc) and the other for non-consumables (shampoo, liquid soap, etc). Within these two categories, there will be different sizes, 16oz, 28oz, etc. The only type of material that can be used is glass and aluminum. If the government mandate all companies do this, then companies who manufacture bottles and containers will compete on price since everything (design, sizes, material) else is standardized. Initially the cost of the bottles&#x2F;containers will be higher but overtime it should go lower as manufacturing companies compete on price and consumers start reusing existing bottles&#x2F;containers. With this mandate, now I can take my used shampoo bottle and refill it at the store (assuming stores offer this). Recycling would be easier as aluminum is profitable for recycling and glass can be washed and be reused. Government can mandate stores that sell things in these bottles&#x2F;containers to take them back. We can even have some form of CRV to encourage people to return&#x2F;recycle them. What kind of disadvantages are there to standardization of bottles and containers? Can the government realistically create such a mandate?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I stopped using my Gmail account several years ago and thought I had switched all of my services over to the new account. Going through my password manager, I realized that because of the name change from HBO Go to HBOMax I missed it and had never switched over my HBO account.<p>So I logged in with my old info and changed my address to my new one. I suddenly started receiving emails about new shows that I have no interest in. The emails have no unsubscribe link in them. I went back to the site to turn off all emails, and it turns out you can&#x27;t turn off emails from HBOMax, only from their &quot;partners&quot; (which I have done). I further discovered that the account for that email isn&#x27;t actually how I get HBOMax. I get it through my cable provider. When I log in with my (formerly) Gmail account, it tells me I don&#x27;t have a subscription. So now I&#x27;d just like to delete the account since I don&#x27;t want emails from them and it&#x27;s not associated with my actual ability to watch their shows. Searching their FAQs, there appears to be no way to delete your account and no way to turn off emails from them.<p>I&#x27;ve found various &quot;How To Delete Your HBOMax Account&quot; articles online (all of them terrible) [0], but the links they say to click on don&#x27;t exist anywhere on the web site anymore (at least coming from Safari on my Mac). Furthermore, they talk about first cancelling your subscription, but as mentioned, this account doesn&#x27;t actually have a subscription, so I can&#x27;t even perform that step. They also mention emailing your username <i>and password</i> to the help email, but that sounds like a terrible idea. There&#x27;s a phone number to call, but I don&#x27;t want to have to deal with a &quot;retention specialist&quot;, though maybe the fact that I&#x27;m not currently subscribed through that email and am not canceling my other subscription would help?<p>Has anyone successfully canceled their HBOMax account, and if so, what did it take?<p>[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;donotpay.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;how-to-delete-hbo-max-account&#x2F;",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
