When I went back in 2018ish I really noticed how now at least 40% kids were fat. I&#x27;m obese too but not Walmart fat. Before there used to be like 2 people among 400. I felt alarmed and sad. I&#x27;ve struggled with weight all my life, don&#x27;t even eat pizza or touch soda for years. I envy people who complain about not being able to gain weight. So it was sad knowing how much it sucks. So many now are way overweight. Which sucks because being handsome kind of matter more in 20s than say in 40s if you are married and have kids etc.<p>I also read that even wild animals are getting fatter.
