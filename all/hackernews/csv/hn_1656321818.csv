Especially for the work part I&#x27;m more and more starting to feel it&#x27;s my duty to help out financially, we&#x27;ve all seen too many stories of underfunded FLOSS projects not having the capacity to fix crucial bugs causing severe security problems, or projects throwing in the towel leaving downstream projects stranded.  Most (all?) of the companies I&#x27;ve worked with in my career depend heavily (completely?) on FLOSS to do their heavy lifting.  A typical business application build upon FLOSS covers less that 1‰ of the entire deployed code base so some compensation for those hard working maintainers and developers would seem helpful.<p>Doing ad hoc donations as I do now doesn&#x27;t feel very constructive to me so I&#x27;m considering to do (automatically) reoccurring donations to my favorite organisations and tools, which doesn&#x27;t seem fair to the stuff I do depend on but don&#x27;t have warm feelings for, but I gotta start some where, right?

We have also identified a critical issue in Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 clusters running versions 13.7 and 14.3. These issues can cause database restarts or failovers under specific conditions. We have developed fixes and are deploying the fixes in two patches. The patches will be automatically applied to the affected instances and clusters in upcoming maintenance windows over the next 3 weeks causing two restarts of your database. One patch will show as a security and stability update and one patch will show as a database update. They will be scheduled sequentially.<p>How to Determine Which Instances are Running These Versions?<p>- In the Amazon RDS console, you can see details about a database cluster, including the Aurora PostgreSQL version of instances in the cluster, by choosing Databases from the console’s navigation pane.<p>- To view DB cluster information by using the AWS CLI, use the describe-db-clusters command.<p>- To view DB cluster information using the Amazon RDS API, use the DescribeDBClusters operation. You can also query a database directly to get the version number by querying the aurora_version() system function i.e., “SELECT * FROM aurora_version();“.<p>Should you have any questions or concerns, the AWS Support Team is available on the community forums and via Premium Support [1].<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;support",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
