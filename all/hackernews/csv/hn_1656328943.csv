31892989,(opinion) AI: The master algorithm fallacy,2022-06-27T11:18:58Z,daly,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"There seems to be the belief that there is a &quot;master algorithm&quot; for consciousness and thought which, if only we could discover it, would enable computers to be conscious.<p>I believe that consciousness and thought are emergent phenomena, similar to a traffic jam. They are not created by algorithm but are a product of a gestalt.<p>A sufficient level of complexity is needed for conscious behavior to arise. Tropism is the simple form. Gains in complexity give rise to more &quot;intelligent&quot; behavior.  While the underlying system needs to be able to remember and change behavior (aka learning) and is necessary, it is not sufficient.<p>While I have no idea how to design a system that has specific emergent behavior, I believe approaching &quot;consciousness&quot; algorithmically is fruitless.<p>The very idea of &quot;emergent behavior&quot; research seems interesting. Such behavior occurs everywhere, such as when a crowd forms with many side-effects, rain turns into floods, cell phone communication destroys privacy and ants create huge structures.<p>What happens when a billion ML systems are randomly interconnected, &quot;learning&quot; from each other and from outside positive &#x2F; negative feedback?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
