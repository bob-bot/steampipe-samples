DelayedSend (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delayedsend.com) is an add-in to schedule messages in Microsoft Teams. You can choose the time, the destination chat (personal or group), and of course the message itself. There is a dashboard to reschedule, edit, or cancel messages if you change your mind.<p>We built this because we work with both Slack and Teams, and we noticed the big convenience gap between the two, with delayed&#x2F;scheduled messages being one of the most glaring ones.<p>On the technical side, the app was built in less than a month, on Azure App Service with NextJS, which was also a fun way to learn something new for some of us.<p>The app is completely free, since it&#x27;s a bit of a side project for now, but we expect to add some premium features in the future, such as recurrence, rich formats, delivery alerts, etc.<p>I&#x27;d love your feedback!

It supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.<p>The Model 3 was based on Real3D Pro-1000 Image Generator, intended for high-end real-time visualization and was state of the art at the time. Real3D itself was spun out of Lockheed Martin’s flight simulator business.<p>Model 3 was specced to handle 1M polygons&#x2F;sec at a buttery smooth 57.524 FPS and featured hardware transformation &amp; lighting, mip-mapping, multi-texturing, and anti-aliasing. It could render both triangle and true quad primitives. Rather than accepting a command list each frame, the Pro-1000 graphics subsystem featured scene graph processing and was capable of parsing a high level graph data structure consisting of view port nodes, transform nodes, and mesh pointers. This minimized the burden on the host PowerPC CPU, which could set up most of the scene in a single frame and transfer only updates to the transform matrices.<p>Two-D graphics are handled by an old-fashioned tile map generator from earlier Sega arcade boards. For audio, a Motorola 68000-based sound board drives two Yamaha-designed Sega Custom Sound Processors (the Sega Saturn console had one of these). Some games featured an MPEG audio board for additional music capability, powered by either a 68K or Z80.<p>Additional peripheral boards included Z80-based force feedback drive boards and a 68K-based network board with low-latency fiber optic link.<p>All are emulated by Supermodel, which today is the only playable Model 3 emulator.",story,https://github.com/trzy/Supermodel,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

31898146,Ask HN: Suggestions for dealing with overwhelm?,2022-06-27T17:54:01Z,jackkkk,2,false,false,1,[31898393],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I have a little over 3YOE and am being forced into a full-stack role from FE development with backend and devops responsibilities with a lot of engineers leaving. Right now I&#x27;m overwhelmed by the number of things that needs to be handled and learn and don&#x27;t really have many seniors I can lean on for help and guidance.<p>I&#x27;d like to look for a new role and a more suitable workload but even then I am overwhelmed by the interview preparation grind. I&#x27;d like to be able to resign and take time off to focus solely on finding a new role with a more manageable workload but I have bills and loans to pay and a family to support (though this is perhaps adding to my feeling of stress and overwhelm) and would like to burn my savings only as matter of last resort. (but how do I know if I&#x27;m at that point?)<p>Things I have tried or am currently doing:<p><pre><code>  - prioritizing sleep and exercise and eating well
  - meditation, maintaining my mental health with biweekly visits to a therapist
  - delegating tasks to juniors (which doesn&#x27;t end as well as I&#x27;d hope)
</code></pre>
Things I am working on:<p><pre><code>  - prioritizing. everything feels so important yet at the end of the day it just feels like I&#x27;m spinning my wheels without making much progress on anything
</code></pre>
Any tips or suggestions?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

31897851,DSLR to mirrorless migration – what to buy?,2022-06-27T17:33:14Z,l0b0,3,false,false,1,[31898488],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Camera manufacturers seem to be moving at speed from DSLRs to mirrorless. In case of Canon, that means a different lens mount. Since I&#x27;ll need to use an adapter for my current lenses anyway, it seems like a good time to re-evaluate brands. Some questions after using a Canon 7D:<p>- Is keeping my lenses and moving to a different brand of mirrorless a dumb idea in the first place?<p>- Can EF mount lenses be fully utilised with mirrorless cameras? That is, can I shoot pretty much the same pictures, or am I going to lose significant light&#x2F;zoom&#x2F;other?<p>- The raw image format is completely proprietary and only used by Canon. Are any of the other vendors better at making life easier for photo editing programs?<p>- The original firmware is not very flexible. For example, requiring an external device for continuous shooting seems crazy. Magic Lantern[1], as impressive as it is, seems to suck battery and the UI is less friendly than the original. And if I understand correctly Canon is making it harder, not easier, for third party firmware with newer models. Are there any particularly good brands for moddability (without having to be a firmware engineer myself)?<p>- The image quality is decent. Within similar price brackets it seems like most cameras are too similar to be a deal breaker. Is that a reasonable view?<p>- Light sensitivity is not great. I don&#x27;t like using flash, which means pretty much anything indoors needs to be fully open and slow. Do any brands&#x2F;cameras stand out in this category?<p>- It works decently as a webcam, except that it outputs a weird format which doesn&#x27;t include microphone audio. Is this still a problem with mirrorless cameras?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;magiclantern.fm&#x2F;",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
