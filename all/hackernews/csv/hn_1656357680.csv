DelayedSend (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;delayedsend.com) is an add-in to schedule messages in Microsoft Teams. You can choose the time, the destination chat (personal or group), and of course the message itself. There is a dashboard to reschedule, edit, or cancel messages if you change your mind.<p>We built this because we work with both Slack and Teams, and we noticed the big convenience gap between the two, with delayed&#x2F;scheduled messages being one of the most glaring ones.<p>On the technical side, the app was built in less than a month, on Azure App Service with NextJS, which was also a fun way to learn something new for some of us.<p>The app is completely free, since it&#x27;s a bit of a side project for now, but we expect to add some premium features in the future, such as recurrence, rich formats, delivery alerts, etc.<p>I&#x27;d love your feedback!

We&#x27;re backed by top tier investors (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snorkel.ai&#x2F;company&#x2F;) and just raised our Series C last year, putting us in a really well strong position to continue building Snorkel Flow and our business. Our customers include some of the world&#x27;s largest enterprises — top US banks, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Chubb, F500 biotechs, and more (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snorkel.ai&#x2F;case-studies&#x2F;) — and we&#x27;re empowering their data science teams to build high quality models in just hours or days instead of weeks or months. But we&#x27;re really just getting started on our journey, and there are so many diverse opportunities for having impact across the company.<p>As a senior front-end engineer, you&#x27;ll build amazing interfaces that will empower developers and non-developers alike to rapidly build, manage, and analyze ML pipelines in Snorkel Flow.<p>Front-end is incredibly important to our mission here at Snorkel. The intuitive—and as some users have called them, fun—workflows we&#x27;ve created to help data scientists and subject matter experts quickly build high quality training data sets and ML models are what set us apart. Right now, we&#x27;re looking for leadership across some major initiatives focusing on 
* performance and snappiness (streaming server-side rendering, SWR, React Suspense etc.);
* deepening our design system and component library (Storybook, Chromatic); and 
* general front-end codebase architecture to make sure we can keep scaling and moving fast.<p>Absolutely no need to have experience or deep familiarity with ML&#x2F;AI, but there&#x27;s no better place and no better team to work with if you&#x27;re interested in learning what it takes to build production ML systems.<p>## Main Responsibilities
* Design and develop key interfaces of Snorkel Flow, including a novel IDE for programmatic labeling, data analysis, and visualization tools
* Advocate and help define standards for the best practices in performance, product quality, security and user experience across the entire application
* Provide mentorship and foster a growth and collaborative mindset for all members of your team.
* Collaborate with cross functional teams on developing large scale products
* Proactively identify technical debt and implement solutions to improve product iteration<p>## Preferred Qualifications
* 5+ years of professional experience with modern React (ES7, React hooks, TypeScript)
* Strong technical communication skills and initiative
* Experience leading front-end projects &#x2F; features
* Product engineering experience building full-stack web applications
* Ability to prototype and iterate quickly around sophisticated user workflows
* Obsession with front-end development best practices, including designing unit and end-to-end tests
* Ability to work in a fast-paced, startup environment<p>You can find more information on our job posting (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;snorkelai&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4136833004), in this FAQ (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snorkel.ai&#x2F;faq&#x2F;), and on our website (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snorkel.ai&#x2F;join-us&#x2F;).<p>If interested, email rakesh.guha@snorkel.ai and sharyl.sun@snorkel.ai.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
