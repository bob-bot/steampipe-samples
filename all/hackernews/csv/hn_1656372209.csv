31901726,Ask HN: Why is mobile keyboard completion so bad?,2022-06-27T22:29:38Z,eslaught,2,false,false,2,"[31902074,31901830,31902157]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN,<p>This has been bugging me for a while. We&#x27;ve got things like GPT-3 that can apparently create text out of whole cloth, and tools like Google Docs that provide the ability to complete sentences with the context of previous words before you even type the next word. And yet the swype-style completion on my smartphone continues to be consistently terrible.<p>As an example, just moments ago I was trying to type &quot;about&quot;, and none of the completion options started with &quot;a&quot; or ended with &quot;t&quot;, let alone resembled the semantic meaning of &quot;about&quot;. And this is not an infrequent occurrence for me; I probably get at most 85-90% accuracy on a good day. That means I&#x27;m missing a word almost every sentence, and the typos are so far off from what I intended that I often don&#x27;t even remember what I intended if I don&#x27;t stop immediately to fix them.<p>Maybe I just type poorly, but I&#x27;d think even a relatively poor input (with the context of previous words) would be good enough to make a pretty accurate keyboard.<p>Does anyone else have this experience? Any ideas why the state of practice isn&#x27;t more advanced at this point?<p>For reference: I&#x27;m on a Pixel device with stock Android keyboard, fully updated. But my experiences have generally been similar on other devices I&#x27;ve used.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
