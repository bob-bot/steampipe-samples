The first bar I wanted to pass was creating an efficient and more realistic path finding engine. Finally, version 0.1.0 of my game Archapolis is released! This is a toy&#x2F;tech demo, but any and all feedback is really important to me, hence I&#x27;m releasing it now (for free).<p>I&#x27;d also like to get an idea how well my code runs on a variety of machines, so if you feel like testing it out, I would love to hear from you and your results!<p>I&#x27;ll talk a bit about the path finding code here:<p>- It will find all possible shortest paths between two points in nearly the same time as Dijkstra&#x27;s, and store them efficiently in a (C++) vector (i.e. array) (max possible paths is the binomial coefficient formula)<p>- An agent can access&#x2F;find a path in constant time (just like a hash table) using some arithmetic (since the vector index is the &quot;key&quot;).<p>- The game will generate the all pairs all possible shortest paths once you place a unit down, and update each time the road network changes.<p>- The path finding algorithm can also utilize preference weights (e.g. beauty, tourism, commercial, cultural neighborhood...) stored in roads. An agent that has a preference will take the shortest path from all possible shortest paths that match their preference.<p>- In the download, these are colored roads for now, so units that match the road color will prefer those roads.<p>- Its multi-threaded. On my machine, finding &#x2F; storing all pairs all shortest possible paths in a 50 x 50 grid (with 9,800 nodes) takes 17 seconds (with six cores) and needs 2.5 GB of RAM. This is an extreme stress test. If using Manhattan block sizes, this is around 13 square miles of city, or roughly nine Cities: Skylines tiles.<p>- In game, roads will be planned first, then placed all at once so only one update is needed.<p>- I&#x27;m really happy with the results. Not only will units utilize all shortest paths between two points, the preference weights gives personality to each unit, so part of my unit AI is already done!<p>- One other note: the one way roads are faster roads (less &quot;weight&quot;), though the agents will still move the same speed over them. They just create faster&#x2F;shorter paths for testing the algo.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;m Andrew, and I&#x27;ve been building https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scribble.run. Scribble makes it easy to add a contract signing feature to your SaaS platform. I ran into this problem at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;criya.co. Criyas customers are mostly interior designers, doing projects for clients. An interior designer needed to be able to upload <i>their</i> contract, and collect a signature from the client before engaging in a design project together.<p>Because I’m not a lawyer, I was hoping to be able to buy instead of build. When I looked around for products in this space, the closest I could find were products that let <i>the company</i> upload documents, add signature fields, and embed them in app. Sure, we could&#x27;ve told people they had to use <i>our</i> standard contract, but that would’ve been awkward, and the interior designers would probably have just gone off platform for signatures.<p>There doesn&#x27;t appear to be anything on the market that lets the <i>end user</i> upload documents, mark them up with signature fields, and require other people to sign them, before programmatically doing other things.<p>After some hacking, here is what I came up with: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=C1wdKyB8Mdg&amp;t=0s.<p>I&#x27;m packaging this up as a bunch of react hooks &amp; components, so engineering teams can maintain control of the UI, making the integration feel exactly like the rest of your product. I&#x27;m a big fan of companies like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clerk.dev or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typesense.org that give me full stack features with mainly front end integrations.<p>I think we are going to see a big wave of &#x27;embedded SaaS&#x27; products in the coming years.

This is more than we have ever spent on AWS all time.<p>CloudFront includes the AWS Shield Standard feature, but somehow, it was not activated for this case (Lambda@Edge calling itself via CloudFront).<p>Now, I understand that I should have created CloudWatch alarms, which would alert me when the number of requests exceeds the limit. The problem is, that they need to be set up per region, and I got CloudFront charges from all points of presence.<p>I am a big proponent of the serverless approach. It makes it easy to scale and develop things (e.g., you get PR review version branches for free, both frontend and backend code like Vercel does). But now, I am unsure because such unexpected charges can ruin a side-project or emerging startup.<p>Now I am waiting on a response from AWS Support on these charges; maybe they can help me waive part of that.<p>What is your experience with it?
