My biggest pain point right now is finding a good designer.<p>We have tried just about everything:<p>- $2k&#x2F;day freelancer through a highly recommended design agency: lackluster, very little value for the money spent<p>- Remote agencies based in Europe: Moderately successful but the design feels a little amateur, and has no personality, i like that they propose lots of options but few of them are close to being usable.<p>- Individual freelancers found on WNW and similar sites: These are ok, they know how to use Figma and can work quickly, but they very rarely propose major improvements. Have to spend lots of time with them and nitpick obvious things to get a good result.<p>I look at other startups sites &amp; apps and they seem polished, fresh, modern, and have some personality to them as well. Did they struggle through many iterations to get there, or are there good designers out there that I am just not finding?
