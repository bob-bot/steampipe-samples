Instead of buying more C batteries, I wonder if I should buy a Bluetooth shower speaker with radio functionality and rechargeable battery.<p>My current shower radio has a very useful feature: By pushing one button, I can turn it on with a timer that will automatically turn itself off. After entering the shower I push the button 5 times for a 10-minute timer. In addition to letting me not worry about remembering to turn the radio off, it&#x27;s also an easy way to time my showers&#x27; length.<p>I would use any replacement device first and foremost as radio, and having the aforementioned timer functionality is important. Being able to use its Bluetooth functionality is also important (otherwise I&#x27;d just get more batteries for my current radio), but I don&#x27;t expect to do so very often.<p>I see numerous no-name Chinese Bluetooth shower speaker&#x2F;radio combinations on Amazon, but can&#x27;t tell how terrible their UI&#x2F;UX is.
