We are not using standard federation, we faced multiple challenges not supported by K8. We looked at this from a different angle than your typical run-of-the-mill k8 deployment since we host multiplayer game servers. Those can’t scale like web apps (stateful connections), and require low latency which prevents steering through many proxies. Our goal was to allow on-demand, in a real-time environment, requests to deploy an application (game servers, or anything really) anywhere on this distributed network. We use this technic to get pods in the best location to lower latency which is critical in multiplayer games. We’ve shown latency reduction by 50% in average for majority of the traffic. We leverage edge computing which is why we called the startup Edgegap. Feel free to ask me anything.<p>I&#x27;m guessing some private infrastructure may have more locations, but they&#x27;re most likely private like food chain or something like that. None of them are public, and they&#x27;re typically built to run only 1 set of applications (aka the apps from the food chain).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Infracost shows engineers the cost of each Terraform change in CI&#x2F;CD before launching resources. When something changes, it posts a comment with the cloud cost impact. e.g. you’ve added two instances and volumes and have changed an instance type from medium to large; this will increase your bill by 25% next month from $1000 to $1250 per month.<p>Over the last few months, I&#x27;ve been working on a native evaluation for Terraform. Previously we relied on the Terraform CLI to fetch cloud resource information, which was a little slow and cumbersome.<p>Native parsing is not only lightning-fast, but it means we have contextual file information, which allows us to try a load of cool new things. For example, we could provide real-time suggestions to optimise your cloud costs as you write your infrastructure code! This VSCode extension is the result of a few weeks of hacking away whilst I should have been relaxing in the sun in Italy... time better spent, I think!<p>We&#x27;re excited about the possibilities of directly integrating with editors. There is so much we can do to make DevOps lives easier when optimising cloud spend. Right now, we&#x27;re looking for your feedback on this initial version of the extension. It currently ships with:<p>1. Show a snapshot of the total cost of resources right above their Terraform definitions. Updated on file save.<p>2. Resource and module blocks support showing cost estimates, including 3rd party module blocks.<p>3. A cost overview web-view shows a detailed breakdown of what components affect the price.<p>Please note this is an early release of the VSCode extension, so there will likely be bugs. If you get stuck, please raise an issue (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;infracost&#x2F;vscode-infracost&#x2F;issues), and we&#x27;ll help you out asap.<p>We’d love to get your feedback on this extension, mainly what you think it’s missing and would help your workflow.

We’re launching Ploomber Cloud today, a service that allows data scientists to scale their work from their laptops to the cloud.<p>Our open-source users (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ploomber&#x2F;ploomber) usually start their work on their laptops; however, often, their local environment falls short, and they need more resources. Typical use cases run out of memory or optimize models to squeeze out the best performance. Ploomber Cloud eases this transition by allowing users to quickly move their existing projects into the cloud without extra configurations. Furthermore, users can request custom resources for specific tasks (vCPUs, GPUs, RAM).<p>Both of us experienced this challenge firsthand. Analysis usually starts in a local notebook or script, and whenever we wanted to run our code on a larger infrastructure we had to refactor the code (i.e. rewrite our notebooks using Kubeflow’s SDK) and add a bunch of cloud configurations. Ploomber Cloud is a lot simpler, if your notebook or script runs locally, you can run it in the cloud with no code changes and no extra configuration. Furthermore, you can go back and forth between your local&#x2F;interactive environment and the cloud.<p>We built Ploomber Cloud on top of AWS. Users only need to declare their dependencies via a requirements.txt file, and Ploomber Cloud will take care of making the Docker image and storing it on ECR. Part of this implementation is open-source and available at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ploomber&#x2F;soopervisor<p>Once the Docker image is ready, we spin up EC2 instances to run the user’s pipeline distributively (for example, to run hundreds of ML experiments in parallel) and store the results in S3. Users can monitor execution through the logs and download artifacts. If source code hasn’t changed for a given pipeline task, we use cached artifacts and skip redundant computations, severely cutting each run&#x27;s cost, especially for pipelines that require GPUs.<p>Users can sign up to Ploomber Cloud for free and get started quickly. We made a significant effort to simplify the experience (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ploomber.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;index.html). There are three plans (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ploomber.io&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;): the first is the Community plan, which is free with limited computing. The Teams plan has a flat $50 monthly and usage-based billing, and the Enterprise plan includes SLAs and custom pricing.<p>We’re thrilled to share Ploomber Cloud with you! So if you’re a data scientist who has experienced these endless cycles of getting a machine and going through an ops team, an ML engineer who helps data scientists scale their work, or you have any feedback, please share your thoughts! We love discussing these problems since exchanging ideas sparks exciting discussions and brings our attention to issues we haven’t considered before!<p>You may also reach out to me at ido@ploomber.io.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
