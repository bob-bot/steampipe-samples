I recently launched the beta version of Let’s Gym and looking for people interested in using this app in hopes to get feedback.
The app idea came up after I moved to a new city and all my buddies back home were the people I worked out with daily. My drive to the gym suffered since the workout “comradely” was no longer there. After speaking to most people around the city it seem it was a common theme of people moving here and not having a workout partner. There are facebook groups in some cities that try and alleviate this issue but the problem was that you couldn’t filter on the workout goal of the person and responses back was more of a miss than a hit using FB.
We are in a very early beta in select cities in the US and would love feedback.",story,https://www.letsgym.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

And I very actively do something about it, not just care.<p>But I find myself in the capital of an European country, with not that many that share same interests, most, of course share just a few, or understand the utility of just few of them, etc. Few have a real drive for living, even if they have money. Most of those who do just party hard, seek validation, etc. The other few that share ambition to grow or do interesting things, are burnt out or depressed.<p>I plan to take my family this summer and move somewhere where I can encounter on a daily basis people that share same values and what I consider a healthy approach on life.
