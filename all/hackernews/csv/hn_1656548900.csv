Hair loss is natural and there are millions of people with more important problems in the world... I know, I know. But still. I get envious when I see men in their 60&#x27;s or 70&#x27;s that have full hair that is not even thinning. I catch myself comparing my hair with other balding men. To see who is &quot;furthest&quot; or who has lost the most. Sometimes I wish I had lost it in my early 20&#x27;s like my brothers cause then it wouldn&#x27;t have become part of my identity.

high school mathematics.  The site includes:<p>1. An introduction to logic through pictures, basically interactive
   Venn diagrams with explanation. This is a point of view on
   propositional calculus.<p>2. A brief presentation of the rules of the logic of &quot;simple type
   theory&quot; at a raw beginner&#x27;s level.<p>3. A number of completely rigorous simple proofs, some in pure logic,
   and some about real numbers, starting from the classic &quot;complete
   ordered field&quot; axioms that define the behavior of real numbers. The
   proofs are all done by computer from the ground up using the logic
   and axioms (with a handful of gaps). The proofs are all available
   for reading online, down to any level of detail, interactively, and
   at the reader&#x27;s discretion.<p>4. A web-based tool that lets you build and edit your own proofs.<p>I am seeking user input on the site, and will gladly answer all kinds of
