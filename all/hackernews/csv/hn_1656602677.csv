The decision wasn&#x27;t popular, but for cost cutting reasons the migration went ahead anyway.<p>The company I work for now however uses both Teams and Slack and we have no plans to migrate fully to Teams. We tend to only use teams for scheduled meetings, but otherwise prefer to chat and call each other via Slack.<p>Personally I much prefer Slack and see Teams as little more than a video conferencing App. From what I can tell most people seem to prefer Slack and few companies have migrated fully to Teams. But perhaps I&#x27;m just in a bubble.<p>Did anyone here migrate from Slack to Teams? And which do you prefer (if either)?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
