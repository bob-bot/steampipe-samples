Here&#x27;s mine:<p>1) &quot;Snake&quot; game ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Snake_(video_game_genre) ).
2) Tetris game ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tetris ).
3) (Microsoft) Paint program, excellent for OOP intro ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Microsoft_Paint ).
4) Ideally some sort of bookkeeping software with forms and a (relational) database behind. 
   In my days I actually used FoxPro, made forms definition very easy. I suppose nowadays this would be web-based?
   But I&#x27;m leaving something much simpler for first web app, see #5.
5) A forum web application ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PhpBB )
6) A client&#x2F;server chat program ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Skype).<p>That&#x27;s a list from the top of my mind, I probably wouldn&#x27;t require someone to write ALL of the stuff above before considering them a programmer.
