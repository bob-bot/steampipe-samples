The key problems they have encountered are a) build times being painfully slow (+5 minutes per content change) and therefore b) the authoring&#x2F;publishing experience is really poor as you can&#x27;t easily see previews. These seem to be common complaints of static site generators (I&#x27;m also skipping over the general complexity required to get a website up and running with so many moving parts)<p>In order to tackle this problem, Gatsby offers a rendering feature called &quot;DSG&quot; (Deferred Static Generation) [2]. When enabled, instead of building all of your content up-front (the entire point of a statically generated site), only your core pages are generated at build-time. The rest of your &quot;long tail&quot; pages are only generated when someone first access them. To use this feature, you need to put a server in-front of your static site.<p>What?! It seems that the build times with statically generated sites have gotten so bad that the work-around is to literally go full-circle and re-create a dynamic website. The two big benefits of statically generated sites are apparently performance and server-less infrastructure, yet to deal with the downsides of generating pages up-front you need to introduce ... dynamically generated pages ... via a server.<p>I don&#x27;t understand who this is for? Any company that requires the touted  performance gains that statically generated sites offer will surely also need quick builds and a good authoring experience?
