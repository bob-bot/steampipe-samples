RPG Maker 95 single handledly got me into programming!<p>Money isn&#x27;t an issue, but I&#x27;d rather not purchase something like a MacBook. I am hoping to find a more open device and have her explore more of it with me.<p>My current thinking is:<p>1. Raspberry Pi, we could set one up with a monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.<p>2. PineBook Pro, seems relatively open and capable enough for her needs.<p>As or software, I am also open to suggestions. I have done Scratch Jr with her on an iPad in the past and she liked it. I am thinking of using Scratch with a keyboard and mouse to get her typing and learning logic&#x2F;creating stuff.<p>I&#x27;d love additional suggestions of fun&#x2F;creative software available on Linux.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
