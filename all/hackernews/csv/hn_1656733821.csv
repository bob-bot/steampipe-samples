This is where Exanaview&#x27;s Immersive AR technology comes in.  With Exanaview AR, a portion of your real world is immersive, so you can still see and interact with the rest of your real world surroundings.  You can collaborate with remote peers during a design review of a large 1:1 scale model while still being able to see family members while working from home or see and talk to co-workers while working at the office.<p>Coming recently out of stealth, Exanaview&#x27;s patented immersive AR is the only AR technology on the market today that provides immersive multi peer collaboration while still allowing users to see their real world surroundings.  See a demo of the technology at the video link below and sign up for access at the website link below.<p>Exanaview&#x27;s new Immersive AR feature:
