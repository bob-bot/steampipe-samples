Not to worry! Beast helps you build your projects with minimal effort and high efficiency, bringing more power to you. In addition, it is super easy to use and syntactically easy to understand, making it suitable for both: beginners and highly experienced programmers.
With its new release: Nimble (v1.1.0), Beast has become much faster and stronger than before. Its build times are now overtaking or matching those of current community standards!!!<p>In contrast to other such build systems, Beast focusses on both: ease of usability and speed!!!",story,https://github.com/GauravDawra/Beast,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

My Portfolio was enough to get my first working student job as a web developer on December 2022.<p>I then started with Tasks like removing the BootstrapVue UI Library and replace with regular Bootstrap in small projects. That took like 60h, because I had to learn vue first. My colleagues said but nothing negative about my work.<p>Yesterday was for me like disaster. I worked until 22 o&#x27;clock, (I had to stop at 17 o&#x27;clock) to find out that I&#x27;m running a microservice in a Docker Container and the changes I made on a mail template had no effect, when I send them, since I was working on local files. I feel myself an idiot and can&#x27;t tell anyone.<p>Am I doing the right job? I can surely say, that I love frontend development and also backend with java and Python.

Later topics use MVVM patterns with GetIt and MobX.
There&#x27;s also an advanced topic on using streams to listen for updates from timers or even external events from Firestore.<p>A good start for someone with a little bit of Flutter but struggling with messy state management.<p>Over 90+ pages and code examples building each example from the last.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
