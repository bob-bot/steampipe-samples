Not professionally but as one of hobbies constantly running in the background.<p>And I still don’t get it.<p>Honestly It still looks like a big scam to me.<p>Some “teachers” say that you just focus your attention on breath or whatever you choose as a focus point.<p>But then isn’t our whole life a sequence of meditations? Because we always focus on something (with sleep breaks).<p>And then following Occam’s razor - why need separate concept for that?<p>Other gurus teach that meditation is “doing nothing”. Okay, but then again there’s nothing special about it, we all do it from time to time.<p>More than that, it means you can’t really practice such meditation, by its definition.<p>Another way to look at it - just sit peacefully and observe your thoughts.<p>Then again, aren’t we doing it anyway on a regular basis without introducing a word for it?<p>Can you please share your own personal specific definition — what exactly is a meditation for you?<p>Please be as detailed as possible and avoid abstract discussions and arguments (I’ve had enough of it already :), just your own experience.<p>Thank you.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
