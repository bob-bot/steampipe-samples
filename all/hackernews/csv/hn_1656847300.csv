Is there an argument I can pass so that it will hide the next div as well?<p>Some context on why I&#x27;m trying to achieve this - there&#x27;s a small subset of users that insert political comments in highly interesting threads and I&#x27;m trying to avoid politics as much as possible so I&#x27;d like to &quot;ban&quot; those users by automatically hiding everything they say.
