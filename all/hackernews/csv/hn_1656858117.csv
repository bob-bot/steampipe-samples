I created a Spotify playlist, and had Alexa routines “shuffle playlist ‘Advice’ on Spotify” at 6am. It works.<p>However, I encountered problems:
- External Cloud&#x2F;network issues would occasionally result in not being able to connect to Spotify. Last thing I want is a system that I can’t trust. 
- Voice interfaces are frustrating. Alexa dots would occasionally soft-advertise services to me. It’s disruptive a peaceful mindset. Accidentally triggering the activation was comically infuriating. 
- I travel frequently, and don’t feel like hauling around an Echo Dot, then setting it up on the hotel network, etc.<p>So… I axed all of the Echo&#x2F;Homepods, and decided to start from scratch.<p>I want a single-purpose physical device, with buttons. Like an old school iPod Nano. I want to add files to it using USB storage. It should have multiple alarms (morning, afternoon, night), each which could shuffle-play a playlist. It should not require an internet connection to function.<p>I was tempted to hack something together with a Raspberry Pi (I suppose you could use cron to open VLC playlist files at custom schedules), but thought to ask here first.<p>This morning, I did some searching for standalone MP3 players. Haven’t found anything that jumps off the page. Sony still has a Walkman, there are some expensive audiophile devices like Fiio. Not a huge fan of touchscreens, even Apple-quality touchscreens are infuriating.<p>Is anyone aware of a product which:
- Standalone, dedicated device (not a smartphone, app)
- USB-accessible storage (USB-C would be great, SD card slot is ok)
- Multiple alarms
- Alarms can shuffle-play a playlist
- Headphones jack out (can plug into speakers while at the house)
- Physical buttons &gt; Touch screen
- Long battery life, can be used as a music player on a road trip
- Easy to use
- High quality - would love to “solve” this problem for 10 years.<p>* For those curious, the advice playlist is “Earl Nightingale ‘The Strangest Secret’ and episodes from ‘Direct Line’. The dude nailed it &amp; it works.<p>Who’s gone down this route and has suggestions?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

31967569,Show HN: I have built a code library for Flutter projects,2022-07-03T13:30:12Z,hnnngwdlch,1,false,false,1,[31967876],<null>,<null>,<null>,"As a Flutter fan since 2019, the number of mobile and web apps I developed with Flutter grew over the years. A nice side effect was that over time, a library of reusable widgets emerged that were often useful in my future projects.<p>For example, there&#x27;s the DashedPathPainter, which converts any path to a dashed path. Similarly, there&#x27;s the AnimatedBorderPainter, which adds an animated border to its child, similar to the Trim Path feature from Adobe AfterEffects. Or the ChatBubble, inspired by WhatsApp and Telegram, which might be useful in an app with a chat function.<p>I built many of these widgets from scratch because I didn&#x27;t want to add another package to my pubspec.yaml for a single function. Of course, I also use packages for dependency injection, state management, or as an add-on for functional programming. But I&#x27;ve never been a fan of adding another dependency to my project, just for a few helper functions or a single widget.<p>I thought that maybe I&#x27;m not the only Flutter developer in this situation. So I came up with the idea for Flutter Code Snippets: a simple code library for Flutter widgets, entire screens, as well as all kinds of helper functions. You can search for the right component, copy the code and paste it into your project. Done! At least that&#x27;s how simple I imagine it to be ;)<p>Since I had already built a small library from my existing projects, I still had to build the frontend (a web app built with Flutter), add authentication and a database (Firestore), integrate a payment flow (Stripe) and write some backend logic (Google Cloud Functions).<p>The result can be seen at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flutter-code-snippets.web.app.<p>I&#x27;m now at a point where I&#x27;ve completed all the basic work I wanted to do, and I&#x27;m looking for another round of feedback. I&#x27;d love for you guys to check it out and let me know what you think.<p>Thanks!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
