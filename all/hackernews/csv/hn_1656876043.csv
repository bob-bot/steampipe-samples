However, I was wondering if it would be a good idea to ask it again (now that 6 years has passed) to gain some new insights from the community.<p>To be honest, I was expecting the rat of change to slow down or at least for the ecosystem to mature but this has not happened; in fact it seems like JS is moving in the _opposite_ direction with the sheer number of tools, frameworks, libraries and build packs that are being released daily at this point.<p>No other language has this problem to my knowledge, so I was wondering if you think this trend will ever stop? Will JavaSript ever evolve to a stable point like other languages (e.g Python, Ruby, Java,..) and if so, how do you envision this coming about?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=12758085",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
