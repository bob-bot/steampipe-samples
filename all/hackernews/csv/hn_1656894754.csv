So far I looked into Western Governors University. Supposedly it has a self paced program which I think might find helpful. I also looked at Oregon State University&#x27;s program it was rated well on college rating sites and they offer counseling and life coaching for students.
Would you have any suggestions?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
