31973333,Ask HN: Are you using composable infrastructure at $DAYJOB?,2022-07-04T03:52:55Z,hardwaresofton,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"So I was doing my semi-yearly colo fantasy scenario and came across pogolinux&#x27;s offering for &quot;composable infrastructure&quot;[0].<p>I don&#x27;t understand it completely yet, but it <i>seems</i> to be dis-aggregated compute, storage and peripherals via networked PCIe. I guess if I had to describe it, I might call it &quot;motherboard-level virtualization&quot;. The hook is that you can provision <i>virtualized &quot;bare metal&quot;</i> -- assemble entire cores, memory, network and other devices&#x2F;peripherals, via software.<p>This lines up with some products I&#x27;ve seen like Ethernet-native SSDs from Kioxia (formerly Toshiba) covered by ServeTheHome[1].<p>I am a huge fan of dis-aggregation and re-use (see: enthusiasm for k8s), and this &quot;composable infrastructure&quot; idea seems amazing, is anyone using this at their day job? What am I missing?<p>Reading through the descriptions the word &quot;open&quot; gets used a lot, but I don&#x27;t know of any actually FOSS implementations of this (which is par for the course with deep server&#x2F;mainframe software)...<p>Considering Amazon is still making waves with Nitro which is more small low overhead DPU&#x2F;FPGAs + traditional hardware, is this really a future path that people are moving towards?<p>I had a quick discussion with someone on the IBM Z mainframe[2][3] which seems to be a similar concept but they couldn&#x27;t tell me too much since it was still quite hush-hush. The idea isn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> the same, because IBM Z is more like &quot;one big blue motherboard + virtual machines&quot;, but considering IBM just moved to offering this as a server[4] it seems like no one actually should be trying to make this concept work locally (i.e. in your own colo&#x2F;DC).<p>Also while we&#x27;re here, is pogo linux the best&#x2F;most cost-effective server assembly site you know of?<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pogolinux.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;composable-infrastructure&#x2F;technology<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_igei5FVeeA<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibm.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;z-and-cloud&#x2F;<p>[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ibm.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;z16<p>[4]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology&#x2F;ibm-is-about-to-launch-its-first-ever-cloud-based-mainframe&#x2F;ar-AAZ0bm5",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
