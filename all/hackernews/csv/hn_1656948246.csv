I am a computational physicist, that means that yes I deal with the horrors of scientific code, etc etc, but the general pitch I make for undergraduate students to join us for two semesters is that they will pick up and practice generalizable &quot;power user&quot; level skills, like working with the terminal, shell scripting for coordinating simulation runs, doing basic analysis (making plots), as well as developing basic performance-minded reasoning. The idea is that these skills are definitely a plus if they are physics or engineering students moving on to graduate work, but are also generalizeable to CS in general in case they want to do data science or something like that eventually.<p>What I&#x27;m asking is how truthful is this? To people who are actual developer types, would an undergraduate research project like ours in computational physics look interesting on a resume if you&#x27;re hiring a fresh graduate? I generally think of myself as adjacent to dev work but not really a developer given the difference in focus and just day to day operations, so I don&#x27;t want to lie to students when I tell them that this is valuable if you want to be a dev someday.<p>I&#x27;m assuming if you ranked  what is remarkable or valuable on a resume for an undergrad, something like an internship at a company is first followed by an undergrad research project in CS followed by working for us, then followed by any other sort of research experience that has no connection to computing in general.
