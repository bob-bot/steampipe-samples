31983046,Invest in Vrilock,2022-07-05T00:22:39Z,vrilock,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Despite the sharp decline in overall VC investment, seed-stage fundraising is unchanged from the previous years. It indicates a strong investor appetite for investing in early-stage, low-valuation startups
And even if some stellar performers from the past such as Meta Platforms Inc. (aka Facebook) are down 55% over the last year – such companies gained thousands of percentages in the past.
So, let’s get some facts straight. Those who listened to Motley Fool Stock Advisor and Rulebreakers from 2002 to 2022 can look back and smile about the investment choices they’ve made:<p>Netflix – +20,374% or 1,208% annualized return
Amazon.com – +19,644% or 1,012% annualized return
NVIDIA – +14,264% or 847% annualized return
Tesla – +13,642% or 1,457% annualized return
Booking – +8,639% or 487% annualized return<p>None of the above is attributed to Metaverse yet. But there will be many metaverse winners in the next 20 years, too. Well, I can only hope that you didn’t just “observe” the meteoric rise of all the above companies?
So, if J.K. Rowling used equity crowdfunding in 1997 and you deliberately walked away - would you live without regret in 2022?
And if Amazon shares were offered to you for $7 per share in Oct 2001 and you decided to pass – would you feel disappointment and remorse today?
Similarly, if Elon Musk pitched to you a Tesla investment for $5 per share exactly 10 years ago and you completely dismissed his pitch – would you openly brag about it today?
We are committed to creating an Equity Crowdfunding campaign that will make history. Hence, VPM is offering the following to our investors:<p>Treasury Shares – each $100 investment will entitle the crowdfunding financier to receive VPM shares from the treasury under the SAFE framework at a 28% discount.
The BIGGEST JACKPOT in Equity Crowdfunding History – one lucky investor will receive an award equal to 10% of the funding received by VPM in this round
Unique Merchandising Credits - toward purchasing VPM digital products (eg. Ebooks, NFTs, etc.) at no additional charge. So, for example, if VPM shareholders invest $100 - they will be also able to order $100 worth of VPM digital offerings<p>Do not repeat the mistakes of the past.

I&#x27;ve looked for this but so far not found much beyond [0] -- although the motivations for this are also touched upon by [1].<p>Scraping is an arms race, of course. A simple but often successful way to fight scraping is, for instance, changing the names of classes routinely. This affects scrapers more than users, because a user doesn&#x27;t see those class names, while a scraper relies on them.<p>Is anyone scraping using only (or mostly) computer vision on the rendered browser screen, and simulating mouse clicks and key presses?<p>It seems like anti-scraping measures to defeat an CV-based approach would be more intrusive to the user and thus they would be used less often.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jimbobewenhall&#x2F;OpenCV-website-scraper
