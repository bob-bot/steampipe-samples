31983426,Ask HN: Games which will help increase my appetite for risk?,2022-07-05T01:42:37Z,afrederico,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;m very risk averse IRL and am prone to &quot;turtle&quot; or &quot;hoard&quot; what I have. This mindset does NOT help me with my investments where a certain tolerance for risk is necessary to get reward.<p>Are there any games (video, not board) that can help me flex my risk tolerance muscle so I&#x27;m able to be less &quot;scared&quot; in reality and less risk averse?<p>Some thoughts on requirements:<p>- Immediate feedback through a failure state: don&#x27;t want to spend 90% of the game building and 10% of the time risking what I&#x27;ve built
- Less about game proficiency&#x2F;mechanics and more about provoking an emotional response which I can then confront and work through
- Would prefer a controlled, PvE environment so I can remove the variables of exploiters and better players from the equation (though this would be something useful to jolt a plateaued learning curve)
- Something that can be done without a sophisticated setup<p>Here are some games I&#x27;ve thought of and why they won&#x27;t work (although I may be approaching them wrong):<p>- Humankind, Civ 6, etc.
    - Risk occurs late in the game
    - Feedback isn&#x27;t immediate and would require analysis
    - Large amount of build-up
- FPS
    - Requires technical and game proficiency
- MMO FPS (Valorant, Overwatch)
    - Too many uncontrolled variables
- Builders, i.e. Rimworld, Factorio, Anno 1800, etc.
    - More micro-manage-y than risky
    - Excessive setup before actual risk is faced
    - Feedback would only occur after analysis<p>I don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know so any ideas&#x2F;comments are greatly appreciated!<p>This is an article I found but it&#x27;s board games: [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.creativelive.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;take-more-risks-board-games&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.creativelive.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;take-more-risks-board-games&#x2F;)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

31983306,Opinion: Structural editing is superior to the Vim grammar,2022-07-05T01:17:43Z,rishflab,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I tried switching from jetbrains to various modal editors (neovim, doom-emacs, kakoune, helix).
The fast startup time and continuity when working in a terminal environment was very appealing,
as was the promise of increased code editing effeciency.<p>I liked the fast startup time and having the same keybindings to edit system config files but
I am not impressed with VIM style text editing. First of all programmers don&#x27;t really edit text,
we edit code. VIM&#x27;s grammar does not acknowledge this. It is centered around lines, words etc.
Code is a tree. In my opinion, you want to keybinds which traverse this tree, expand&#x2F;shrink selections etc.<p>Of course I can install tree-sitter and setup structual editing based bindings but am I really
using VIM at this point? I don&#x27;t think the VIM grammar is the future of code editing.
I think it is a bit overrated. I think editor designers should work on developing a grammar&#x2F;keybinds
that center around structural&#x2F;tree based editing.
I have found that IDE&#x27;s tend to acknowledge this tree based
&quot;reality&quot; better than VIM.<p>I think this concept could even be applied to source control ie. git stores an tree-sitter like
representation of code instead of text. Your text editor handles formatting.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
