I’ve been sailing through a series of meetings, deadlines, changing project requirements, office politics and general life that the caring of the craft is at the bottom of my list of cares.<p>I used to care about the craft in detail: getting formatting in code right, following best practices, seeking the new more efficient way to do things. But now it’s just get it done and push onto the next thing.<p>Thankfully starting to do some summer technical book reading has ignited that care for craft in me again.<p>So I ask you all, do you care about your craft? Why or why not?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
