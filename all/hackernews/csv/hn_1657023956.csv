The work isn&#x27;t difficult or complex but completing it takes forever due to all the hand-offs and errors caused by a lack of up-to-date documentation. I can&#x27;t grow the team because their culture makes it really difficult for new people to come up to speed.<p>They don&#x27;t even follow the docs that they have, and they certainly don&#x27;t update them when they notice errors or omissions.  In some cases, I&#x27;ve witnessed them performing a task that is documented on a Wiki page (last updated: 2016!), but they skip some steps, perform others differently from the doc, and do things not covered in the doc at all.  When I asked why they don&#x27;t update the docs, they respond with claims of &quot;it&#x27;s not my doc&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s owned by Team X&quot; so they can&#x27;t change it.<p>They rarely describe the solution for bug fixes in the Jira ticket and instead just declare it fixed and pass it to QA so the knowledge stays with the person that fixed the bug. They&#x27;ve even refused to share their screen during live debugging sessions and instead just loosely describe what they&#x27;re doing in words.<p>How can I foster a culture of information sharing?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

31987190,Software development tends to get mundane,2022-07-05T12:06:18Z,rrishi,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello HN,<p>I have been a professional software engineer for four years. I also have a bachelors in CS.<p>During my career, I have found that there are some aspects of developing software that are incredibly boring to me.<p>I don&#x27;t enjoy debugging. Often times I have spent hours&#x2F;days hunting bugs that turn out to be annoyances rather than learning opportunities. This period tends to be a drab and very unstimulating.<p>I also don&#x27;t find the act of interacting with a screen very intimate. I would much prefer pen and paper over a computer screen.<p>Software development also often becomes an exercise in cobbling together a bunch of APIs to achieve a business requirement. This feels like I am accomplishing something for my company but not really adding or discovering new knowledge.<p>During university, I enjoyed theoretical Computer Science courses (ex. Automatons, Number Theory etc.) a lot more than the practical ones (ex. Networks, DB etc.). If I were to do everything over again, I would prefer to go into academia rather than software engineering. At this point going to academia isn&#x27;t feasible as I never developed relationships with profs to get a Letter of recommendation. My people skills are pretty poor but it is what it is.<p>Learning software engineering patterns and practices doesn&#x27;t feel &quot;profound&quot;. Instead it just feels trivial.<p>I am confused how to resolve this conundrum. 
A radical way would be to stop software career, take up math or theoretical CS and go into that. But this has some drawbacks. I am nearly 30 and going back to university at this point isn&#x27;t ideal. Plus, the money in software engineering helps me to be independent and be a pillar of support for my family.<p>Another way I could resolve this conundrum would be to take up math&#x2F;theoretical CS as a hobby. However, I am not sure if I will be able to dedicate enough time to it. Software engineering jobs can get taxing. Add to that the burden of doing basic household chores, exercising etc. the time to dedicate to theoretical CS&#x2F;math may get limited. But still, this alternative seems a lot more &quot;practical&quot; than giving up everything in my career and making a complete pivot.<p>What are your thoughts on this HN community?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
