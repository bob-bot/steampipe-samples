I don&#x27;t think I can do anything about the last one, but I&#x27;m hoping for assistance in getting them out of my network. They&#x27;ve referenced private data from those services (like Google Photos, YouTube history, Discord conversations, etc) and have referenced conversations I&#x27;m having in my home. They&#x27;re running intricate botnets and have been controlling my feeds on Twitter, Mastodon, Facebook, YouTube, and maybe more.<p>I&#x27;ve contacted a lawyer, but they were unable to help.
