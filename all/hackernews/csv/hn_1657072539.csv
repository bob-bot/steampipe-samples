31995921,Ask HN: What alternatives are there to Reddit? Mods have ruined the site,2022-07-06T01:54:24Z,abcdjdjd,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"So, I am trying to find a good alternative to reddit. Reddit used to be good, but it is clear that the admins and mods have ruined the website.<p>Mods regularly abuse their modding powers by deleting posts they don&#x27;t like (regardless of what the rules say) or ban those they disagree with. It is so common that it is practically a meme at this point.<p>Automod is also abused and is overused and has restrictions often set too high. See subs like unpopularopinion for an example like that. Practically every post onto that sub is removed automatically.<p>I&#x27;ve also even seen automods ban users who dare post on a sub that some mod doesn&#x27;t like. Completely childish.<p>Admins are part of the problem as well. As they seem to both encourage this behavior from the mods and also make it impossible for users to have any recourse against an abusive mod.<p>All this leads to what I would call an unusable site for any meaningful discussion. It simply turns into a website that is an echo chamber for the mods of that sub.<p>With that said, I think reddit COULD be good if the mods weren&#x27;t such an issue.<p>Are their any good alternatives to reddit at this point? That provide the same sizable community where you can discuss and share ideas on different topics without abusive mods, groupthink downvoting, or other issues?<p>It just seems like on the one side, you have reddit. On the other extreme side, you have sites like 4chan. It would be nice to have some site where you can have meaningful discussions without openly being called the &quot;N-word&quot; (4chan) every other post, but at the same time not banned or censored every second you disagree with the mods or admins (reddit).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
