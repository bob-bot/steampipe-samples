31996484,Ask HN: Create your workflow across apps with drag and drop. what do you think?,2022-07-06T03:49:52Z,zhangruinan,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I know there have already been many great tools like Zapier and IFTTT for predictable and repetitive workflows. But for many other workflows, the result and call-to-action require human intellect to engage with, for example: for PM or customer service, they have to collect customers&#x27; feedback and bug reports (say from discord) to development plan (say kanban in Notion).

For example, a sorting algorithm for a human to sort a pile of books or papers, or a structure for someone to manage a large bookshelf so that they can find a book quickly given its name.<p>Obviously, human algorithms should be designed with different assumptions than computer algorithms. Humans can insert objects into an array in near constant time, don&#x27;t have constant time random access, and physical objects can&#x27;t be copied, etc. These assumptions change the properties of existing algorithms, and may raise new algorithms into view under these new assumptions. But exactly how? What term should I start searching with?<p>This question originally came out when I collected and hand-sorted hundreds of exam papers as a TA.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
