So I have plenty of time to listen to Podcast and audiobook on my ride. And I think it would be nice to be able to do the same with my reading list, but I couldn&#x27;t find any decent app on the market that doing this. So I set out to do it myself.<p>Sooo this is the product: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sendtopod.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sendtopod.com&#x2F;</a><p>You may ask why?<p>The reasons are simple:<p>- It&#x27;s more convenient to listen to articles while you driving, running, or even before going to bed.
- Listen take less effort than reading.
- Your eyes need to rest after staring at screens all day.
- Podcast app is a great tools for listening to audio content with support for:
  - CarPlay, Android Auto support built-in
  - Smart queuing
  - Offline listening<p>I see that <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hq.getmatter.app&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hq.getmatter.app&#x2F;</a> did a great job of read later app, it also have an OK text to speech audio, but does not have a podcast feed I can subscribe to.<p>I also see AudioRead.com do this but text to speech is IMHO not pleasant enough to listen to for a long time.<p>I&#x27;m running beta for this, would love to hear your feedback on ... anything really.<p>Thanks you all!",story,https://sendtopod.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Even if they seem to have a broad understanding of a topic (say, software engineering), they refuse to understand why people from a related area (say, project management or design) do things in a way that might not fully appeal to them.<p>Most of these people generally have a high intellect and are fast learners, not just in their profession, yet they don&#x27;t seem to be able to see <i>why</i> other people might have different believes.<p>An example can be found in this video:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HURvJDldVGA<p>In it, the author talks about why a programmer might hate Scrum. Going into it, I thought they might point out things I, or the dev team can improve to make Scrum fun again. Yet, the only people that are blamed are project managers, and
never the programmers, which seems to be the profession of the author. While I somewhat agree with their points, I highly doubt that it&#x27;s <i>never</i> the fault of a programmer, which is implied in this video.<p>Another example for this is farming and politics. I grew up in a family of farmers. Ranting about how politicians are destroying our industry was 90% we ever talked about. If I talk to some other people, it&#x27;s the farmers who are
destroying our planet.<p>Do people actively ignore other opinions to leverage a better outcome for themselves, or are our brains just not able to find a common ground?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
