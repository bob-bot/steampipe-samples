I want to share with you something we&#x27;re working on from some months, Codelia Headless CMS (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeliacms.com&#x2F;). It&#x27;s a content platform based on APIs that makes able to model content without touching any line of code and to deliver omnichannel content from one unique workspace.<p>THE PROBLEM
There is a lack of synergy between marketing and development teams while using usual and popular CMSs, they usually need to update the code of a custom web project to add a content model or a content field for example, involving developers. This brings to the lost of working hours and money.<p>THE SOLUTION
Marketing teams can work on their own way modeling content without touching any line of code and without developers, delivering it on multiple devices at the same time from one unique workspace. Developers can work with any tech stack and without limitations. In this way it&#x27;s possible to save working hours and budget, launching faster.<p>I encourage you to try the free trial (no credit card required), and I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
