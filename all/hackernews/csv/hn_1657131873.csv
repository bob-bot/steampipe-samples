Possibly all at the same time.<p>What should I buy? Budget is 20-40k.<p>I&#x27;m wondering in particular:
- Is the HBM2 memory on an A100 worth the 2x price over a A6000?<p>- Should I go for a tower (such as the Lenovo P620) or a 2U rack? (space and power are irrelevant to me)<p>- Are there hidden costs with major suppliers (I really don&#x27;t want to pay $1k for a 4TB dell hdd)<p>- Are there any gotchas with report to lights out management? I.e. can I remote reboot a threadripper machine?<p>Thanks!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
