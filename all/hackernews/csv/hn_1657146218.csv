I’ve basically lost all drive these last few months to go solo. I quit my job and started traveling with the intention of moving to NYC after I&#x27;m done traveling solely to find a partner. The stock market crash on growth stocks definitely hasn’t helped my enthusiasm here as it looks like I’m grinding <i>alone</i> for <i>another</i> decade. How does one go about finding a high earning partner? It doesn’t have to be in tech - I’m open to law, medicine, finance, etc. I’m looking for someone who is earning similar FAANG comp but I have no idea where to find these people. It seems like online dating has them <i>but</i> I’m not physically attractive enough for online dating. I don’t know if that’s a market I can actually get through to but I feel it’s my only real option. At this point - I’m thinking of forking over $50k on image consultation, photos, personal training, and surgery to get me closer. I have already had surgery but it seemed to be inconsequential - so, I am not optimistic here.<p>I’m practically ready to settle for someone who wears a bag over their face and is a mute in order to just get by in life as long as they can pay the bills but I can’t even find that. Where do these people exist? How do you find a high earning partner <i>who is single</i>? I’ve found many that aren’t single but none that are.<p>I’m also wanting kids and I’m totally willing to be a SAHP. If mommy wants to play corporate wargames, be my guest. I’ll even pay for a surrogate if she’s worried about pregnancy woes! (Please get me out of corporate wargames!)<p>I suspect many of you - like most of my peers - met your partner in college, grad school, or very shortly thereafter. For those who didn&#x27;t though (and in the last five years preferably since the dating market has changed drastically in the last 5-10 years) - any tips?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
