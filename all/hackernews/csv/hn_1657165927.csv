32009704,Ask HN: Evaluating if an idea's attractive because it appeals to your biases?,2022-07-07T03:50:19Z,MollyRealized,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I recently read a piece that painted a doomsday scenario for the near future.  I found afterward I couldn&#x27;t trust my cognitive evaluation (&quot;believable, accurate, likely to happen&quot;) because my existing root-level <i>emotional</i> biases about &quot;the way the world works&quot; were influencing my mind&#x27;s cognitive evaluation of the theory, making it more likely.<p>If you&#x27;ve seen ROBOCOP 2, I can kind of explain this more simply.  In ROBOCOP 2, Murphy awoke to find that he had 200+ new instructions now each as important as his original three.  His brain from moment to moment had to treat those instructions as &#x27;true&#x27;, cognitively.<p>Similarly, my brain seems to treat some of these emotional biases as automatically root-level &#x27;true&#x27;.  Murphy threw himself against a power grid to reset the problem.  I&#x27;m not looking to get electroshock anytime soon.<p>I&#x27;m interested in mental habits, routines, or steps - either in the form of your anecdotes or of references to classic or modern approaches - that help you discern if your own root-level biases are causing you to misperceive or incorrectly evaluate a situation.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
