32011802,First Academic Paper by Apache ShardingSphere Accepted by ICDE,2022-07-07T09:43:58Z,Yamy,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Recently, “Apache ShardingSphere: A Holistic and Pluggable Platform for Data Sharding”, co-authored by the Apache ShardingSphere community, SphereEx Lab and the Department of Computer Science of Chongqing University, has been accepted by The International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), one of the top international conferences on data engineering and databases. This conference paper is the first one focusing on data sharding in the database industry.<p>ICDE is a top-level academic conference on databases and data mining, as well as the flagship conference of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the world’s largest technical professional organization for the advancement of technology. ICDE, ACM SIGMOD Conference and International Conference on Very Large Data Bases are known as the top three data management and database conferences in the world.<p>This paper&#x27;s publication represents the culmination of 5-year of R&amp;D and implementation testing for Apache ShardingSphere guided by its Database Plus development concept. The acceptance of this paper stands as a testament of the acknowledgment of Database Plus, Apache ShardingSphere’s enhanced computing engine and plugin-oriented architecture by the academic community.<p>Thanks to the acceptance of this paper, our community is proud to announce that our efforts have led to innovative breakthroughs in core database technologies.<p>In this paper, the co-authors propose that: considering that today relational databases that are not scalable and efficient enough to solve high concurrency problems still dominate online transaction processing and that NewSQL databases could lead to additional training costs, the database middleware Apache ShardingSphere becomes a very friendly and efficient way to connect and manage multiple databases.<p>Why Did We Choose to Improve the Database Ecosystem Rather Than Creating a New Database?<p>The aim of Apache ShardingSphere is to better utilize the computing and storage capabilities of relational databases in distributed scenarios, rather than implementing a new type of relational database.<p>So far, as relational databases are still the best choice for complete transactions, they are often used to handle online transaction processing. However, the relational database is designed for a single machine. In other words, at the initial stage developers did not take big data into account. In short, relational databases are less scalable to efficiently solve high concurrency problems.<p>In this context, NewSQL came into being. However, New means this type of database is developed from scratch. Although it is suitable for current application scenarios, it has not been tested in enough real production environments, and for enterprise maintainers, it has a steep learning curve.<p>Apache ShardingSphere just released its official version 5.1.0. With this update, Apache ShardingSphere has also shifted its positioning to Database Plus with the desire to build the standard and ecosystem above different databases. Apart from enhanced capabilities, the Database Plus architecture also opens up a highly scalable database ecosystem for developers and users.
Conclusion<p>Apache ShardingSphere has been adopted and tested by hundreds of enterprises, from the Internet, gaming, banking, insurance &amp; securities, manufacturing, telecommunications, new retail sectors to the public sector, etc., and has been tested in multiple production scenarios.<p>With its first paper being included in ICDE, Apache ShardingSphere’s concept has now been recognized by the academic community. The paper will provide new solutions for the development of the database industry and the improvement of data processing efficiency.
We hope this paper and Apache ShardingSphere’s exploration can inspire developers and scholars inthe database field to build databases into a data service platform that is closer to enterprise business scenarios.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32012004,Build Network Effects for Your SaaS Startup,2022-07-07T10:09:20Z,prasenjit_pro,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"The very best startups build network effects along with utility value.<p>My startup, on the face of it, is just a utility tool. It’s a Rotating Proxy Service. Programmers call the API with a URL and based on that, I fetch the contents of the URL using proxies and give it back to their crawlers — end of the story.<p>But as a company, that’s not the only value I accumulate or provide. We talk to every customer about their exact needs and see all the problems they face in the whole process of web crawling and web scraping. We are very, very interested in knowing all their issues, knowledge, and lack of it, questions, doubts, options, ideas, failures, and successes. We ask them directly, we infer them by looking at our data, and we look for them actively on the internet. People have many questions on sites like Quora, Reddit, Hacker News, and other forums about Web scraping.<p>Getting into scenes rather than working in isolation builds another subtle value, the value that emerges as a part of a network. It&#x27;s not just utility value. Like Facebook, as more and more people join the system, the cost of Facebook increases for every single user. That’s a network effect.<p>That’s why even when marketing, we want to end up creating network effects in the long run. An ad, for example, works to get you a visit and even a customer, but it doesn’t accumulate any value. A blog post, for example, is slower to produce amount, but it will live forever and produces data network effects.<p>Quora is an example of data network effects gone wild. As more people ask, view, rate, and answer questions, the value of Quora increases for everyone. We want to be tied into that value growth.<p>The more we participate in communities like this, post our ideas and thoughts liberally and generously on our blog, on medium, Linkedin, Facebook, etc., the more people find value in interacting with us. It is not just signing up to our service and uses it. It is this collective value of the content we have produced, The understanding of the space and its problems that we have painstakingly accumulated by poking our nose into peripheral issues that we didn’t have to get in. Talking and participating in efforts and discussions that are pushing the boundaries of web scraping is felt and is a benefit to a lot of our existing and new customers. I imagine this whole thing that we do, as an organism, slowly but surely moving, having a life of its own and getting more valuable as it grows in size, in connections, in knowledge, in empathy to the problems and goodwill. All this adds up to the product experience. It is tough work — especially in the beginning when you see no results, but it is now working for us.<p>This overall network effect also produces a highly defensible company as a side effect. It is complicated to compete with a company like this because of this level of moat. The value doesn’t just rest in the features but also leans heavily in the network, both of data, search engine rankings, and even human connection and goodwill.<p>The author is the founder of Proxies API (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.proxiesapi.com&#x2F;) the rotating proxies service.
