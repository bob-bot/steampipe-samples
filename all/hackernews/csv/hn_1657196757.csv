Up until 4 August 2022, you will still be able to use Pocketbook as you do today.
From 5 August 2022, your Pocketbook account will be closed and you will no longer be able to download the app, or log into the mobile app or the web version of Pocketbook.<p>What does this mean for your data?
We will be deleting all personal information you have provided to us while using the Pocketbook service. This may include your email address, personal name(s) and mobile number.
We will also securely delete your personally identifiable financial account and transaction information from 5 August 2022.<p>What should I do next?
If you would like to keep your categorised transaction data, you will be able to extract it into a CSV file until 4 August 2022.
