Mostly using Eric Brechner&#x27;s &quot;is this task less than 5 days?&quot; to break work down and put it on the board.<p>So far this has worked out well for 3 developers on the team -- they work hard, communicate often, and really try to push the ball down the field every day. Code is checked in on a daily &#x2F; every other day basis and overall have a high degree of &quot;accountability&quot; to work hard every day.<p>We brought on a senior backend developer in May who had previously worked at a bank for 10 years. He was meant to be a key hire to take over on some of my involvement with the backend codebase (note that I am not the original author, it was originally written by a previous contracting house). Overall I would describe him as &quot;okay&quot; -- has been slow on his tasks (&quot;is this less than 5 days&quot; = 5 days), overshooting timelines that he gives (everything is always &quot;1 or 2 days away&quot;) , and &quot;okay&quot; quality.<p>- I&#x27;m a developer and understand that there is an element of &quot;it takes as long as it takes&quot;, but I want to start thinking in days instead of weeks for tasks<p>- I had a 1-on-1 with him today and he describe it as &quot;relaxed&quot; which is definitely not how I&#x27;ve been feeling<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure what to do in this situation -- clearly there is an element of mismanagement on my end, but there is also an element of &quot;this person is not driven like the rest of the team&quot; that I don&#x27;t quite know how to handle. How do you determine how much is your own failure as a manager, versus how much is someone just &quot;not working out&quot;?<p>- Do I just need to get really specific about asking &quot;how long will this take&quot; for every task and then trying to hold his feet to the fire when we get there? What does this look like?<p><pre><code>    - &quot;You said 2 days ago that it would be done in 1-2 days, what&#x27;s going on?&quot; What if they come up with excuses?
