32019914,Ask HN: Should I leave my socio-sentimental local minimum?,2022-07-07T21:46:51Z,canthrowaway,2,false,false,1,[32020275],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN, obviously posting from a throwaway account. In the recent past, I struggled with depression, due to burnout at work + loneliness. I started getting better with therapy, but I hit another low when once I started recovering, tried to date people, and failed catastrophically at attracting women.<p>After a couple of relapses, today I can say that I feel way better than before. I have a decent work-life balance, I don&#x27;t get stressed, I don&#x27;t have anxiety, I don&#x27;t have social anxiety, I do exercise, I basically don&#x27;t care much about stuff. I&#x27;m really stable mentally, which to me is a big accomplishment, and have been consistently feeling like this for some months.<p>I&#x27;m usually alone (live alone and work on my own stuff, basically), but from time to time I meet 1 person for lunch (e.g., a colleague from work). I do this, say, once a week or so.<p>So, now I feel like I have a decent quality of life and good mental stability, a big accomplishment, but at the same time, it&#x27;s true that I&#x27;m suppressing my instinct of trying to date people. I&#x27;m purposely avoiding any dating situation, because I know that with very, very high probability, the answer is going to be no, and this might affect my beloved mental stability. While it&#x27;s tempting to think: &quot;it&#x27;s a numbers game, it shouldn&#x27;t affect you, you should try it&quot;, in one of the depression relapses I mentioned, what happened was precisely that I got lots of rejections in a row; enough rejections so that I don&#x27;t take rejections personally anymore; a single rejection doesn&#x27;t affect me, but what does affect me is having virtually always the same result: a rejection.<p>So, HNers who have been a similar situation, what would you do? Would you stick to my local minimum, or would you try to leave it by going back to the dating game? If so, any strategies for getting another relapse?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
