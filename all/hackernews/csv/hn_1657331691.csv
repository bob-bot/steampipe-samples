32030553,Ask HN: What programming languages distinguish between “old” and “new” values?,2022-07-09T01:54:30Z,aappleby,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Suppose I have this trivial C++ program:<p><pre><code>  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  int a = 0;
  int b = 0;

  void update_state() {
    a = b + 1;
    b = a + 1;
  }

  int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {
      update_state();
      printf(&quot;%d %d\n&quot;, a, b);  
    }
    return 0;
  }
</code></pre>
This will print<p><pre><code>  1 2
  3 4
  5 6
</code></pre>
which shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising. What it does _not_ print is:<p><pre><code>  1 1
  2 2
  3 3
</code></pre>
because &quot;b = a + 1&quot; is reading the &quot;new&quot; value of A, not the &quot;old&quot; value as you might expect if you were a new programmer just skimming through the source. If we wanted that behavior we could write<p><pre><code>  void update() {
    int a_old = a;
    int b_old = b;
    a = b_old + 1;
    b = a_old + 1;
  }
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>  void update() {
    int a_new = b + 1;
    int b_new = a + 1;
    a = a_new;
    b = b_new;
  }
</code></pre>
but in both cases we have to introduce new temporary variables to hold a copy of either the &quot;old&quot; or &quot;new&quot; state so we don&#x27;t clobber one of them. If we could annotate our variable names with &quot;oldness&quot; and &quot;newness&quot; we could write something like this:<p><pre><code>  void update() {
    a_new = b_old + 1;
    b_new = a_old + 1;
  }
</code></pre>
But that won&#x27;t work in plain C because &quot;_old&quot; and &quot;_new&quot; aren&#x27;t meaningful suffixes. More importantly, we can&#x27;t realistically implement <i>any</i> way of explicitly distinguishing between old and new values in C++ at all - classes and templates don&#x27;t quite give us enough flexibility to do so.<p>In this trivial example it&#x27;s easy to see why the different update() methods produce different results, but in large systems it&#x27;s surprisingly easy to introduce subtle bugs by changing the order of function calls : ClassA expects to read some &quot;new&quot; state from ClassB, code gets refactored, ClassA now inadvertently reads &quot;old&quot; state from ClassB, everything appears to work fine until one day a timing issue causes ClassA and ClassB to get out of sync and everything blows up.<p>After looking around at existing programming languages (and some CS papers from Google Scholar), it doesn&#x27;t appear that any major programming languages support this sort of annotation. The closest you can get is the &quot;&lt;=&quot; operator in Verilog, which means something like &quot;assign the RHS to the LHS, but don&#x27;t do it yet - do it after the current simulation step is done running&quot;.<p>I feel like this is probably a thoroughly covered topic already, but my research skills are failing to turn up anything relevant. Is there some computer sciencey term I&#x27;m unaware of to describe languages that allow for these sorts of old&#x2F;new distinctions?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
