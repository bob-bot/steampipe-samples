I am okay with that, I do not like Facebook culture much.<p>But I am interested about scientific, technical, dev related news like new libraries &#x2F; products &#x2F; research articles. I have FOMO for those things. I want to stay updated about those things, since those new things(libraries, products) can help me to save time in my work. I mostly use HN, Reddit to get news, updates. But I cannot keep watching those platforms for every day since my ADHD loves stimulating things and I keep running into rabbit holes where I do nothing for the rest of the day. I was thinking about only visiting those platforms once month, but a lot of content have gathered during the month and I may have a lot of  missing things too.<p>I know new libraries &#x2F; products &#x2F; research may get outdated, discontinued, invalidated quickly, but there can be things that last a while which I may be interested. Furthermore, I know with information is exploding on the platforms I mentioned and no one will be able to keep update about every thing and most info are of poor quality. What I want is to keep up to date about the domains I am interested on those platforms.<p>Currently, I use RSS feeds to keep up-to-date with things I am interested, but I have no solution for platform like HN, Reddit (I know there is RSS for those platforms, but they are not smart enough to recommend what I am interested) Is there any solution for this?<p>Or are there any practical tips to tackle this FOMO issue?<p>Or should I accept that I will miss things, it is okay, check those platforms when I can?<p>Any advice highly appreciated!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
