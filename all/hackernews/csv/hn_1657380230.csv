I&#x27;d love to hear how HN users would think of bootstrapping a telco?<p>We&#x27;ve had a few startups try and disrupt things in Canada (e.g., Wind Mobile). They were funded by large global investment groups and eventually simply got acquired by the incumbent telcos.<p>The other approach I&#x27;ve seen is piggybacking on existing telco infrastructure. This is required by law since the Canadian government subsidizes telco infrastructure... It&#x27;s not uncommon for the telcos to renege on their contractual&#x2F;legal obligations. Plus, this doesn&#x27;t create any redundant networks.<p>So: how else can one launch a telco? What creative solutions have folks seen?<p>I&#x27;m thinking: VOIP-only service that has direct access to the Internet backbone in Toronto, Vancouver, etc. so you can at least have completely separate service in major cities...
