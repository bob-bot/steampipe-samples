Everything else gets transferred to the cloud, thereby providing &quot;unlimited&quot; storage space or at least &quot;greater than your hard disk size&quot;.<p>Does such a software already exist?<p>If not, would that be of interest to the community?<p>Thanks for any insight&#x2F;comment&#x2F;suggestion.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The general flavor of the songs and artists popping up on track radios was so alien to me. Streaming services have replaced radio and the algorithms used to feed the listener have taken on the role of the DJ.<p>I&#x27;m curious if there is a way someone has found to use one service&#x27;s algorithm to fetch content that is consumed on another.
