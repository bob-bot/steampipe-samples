The bots all fit a similar profile - they are young attractive females with Hispanic-sounding names that leave generic pleasantries or inoffensive non-sequiturs. Due to the channel&#x27;s niche subject matter, a person fitting that description is probably the least likely person on the planet to be a subscriber so they stick out like a sore thumb.<p>I&#x27;m trying to understand what is going on here, since they simply add noise to the comments section. One theory is this particular creator - who is vocally obsessed with viewers and hit count - has purchased bots to artificially increase the views, and these comments are a method to evade Google&#x27;s anti-abuse software by posing as legitimate viewers leaving innocuous-sounding comments.

Encyclopaedias were also nice for this, but the science textbooks really were my favorite.<p>The closest thing I’ve found is YouTube channels, but great ones aren’t necessarily super common, and I don’t know if any with a wide scope. Wikipedia I often find the articles are too complex when you get into specific topics.<p>The purpose is just for fun and intellectual stimulation, so not really looking for educational programs.
