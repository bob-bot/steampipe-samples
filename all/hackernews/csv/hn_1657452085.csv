Some call it the Linux of the cloud.<p>And because K8s is only a kernel, there are now over 2000+ (open source) projects, all adding some extra functionality to it. Be it for observability, security, or networking. But all of these projects don&#x27;t really collaborate and end-users don&#x27;t ask for maturity of individual projects, they want sets&#x2F;stacks of projects that integrate well.<p>Now every company has created some Stack with applications and configurations for Kubernetes, all trying to reinvent the wheel and spending an often shocking $ in doing so.<p>So here is my take:<p>- Let&#x27;s create a new category in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape and call it Integrated Stacks for K8s<p>- To be accepted, a stack needs to provide an open integration framework for other projects to add&#x2F;integrate their apps<p>- Just like aLinux distro, each stack is ideal for some specific use case(s)<p>- A stack can be installed in one run, contains integrated apps that work out-of-the-box, has a (web) UI that acts as a desktop environment to provide easy and secure access to all features. Call it a new user experience for Kubernetes<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be great to have a list of all Kubernetes stacks available that everyone can use (and contribute to)? Just like (in the Linux analogy) you can choose between Linux Mint, Fedora, or Ubuntu.<p>We already created the first: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;redkubes&#x2F;otomi-core",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
