32046684,Ask HN: Why do people get things when they “give up.”?,2022-07-10T17:22:27Z,actfrench,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I recently found an extraordinary technical co-founder for my company, after years of trying every possible strategy. He&#x27;s 100 times more creative, passionate, expert and an ideal fit for me personally and from a business perspective, a friend I&#x27;ve known for years and seemingly popped back up out of the blue after I stopped trying and was ready to give up on the whole thing.<p>I&#x27;ve heard this advice of &quot;give up&quot; and it comes for years.<p>Give up on trying to find love and then you get the partner
Give up doing a million interviews and then you get the job
Give up trying to cure your alcoholic and your partner decides to go to AA on their own<p>I&#x27;m assuming this has something to do with the principal of &quot;non-attachment&quot; or not putting out a vibe of neediness, but it&#x27;s still curious to me. Wondering if there&#x27;s more to it than that.<p>And is there any way to enforce this state? Seems pretty hard to give up on something as a means to get it, so there&#x27;s an inherent paradox.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
