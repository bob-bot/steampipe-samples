32052591,Fear of failing in this field is giving me severe senioritis,2022-07-11T05:34:27Z,irisedhaze,2,false,false,1,[32052770],<null>,<null>,<null>,"This is quite a personal post. I just want to ask this community&#x27;s advice because I feel like my life is going in a downward spiral already.<p>First off, I&#x27;m not from the US or any country which has a major impact on global tech development. Most tech jobs here are either in big local companies or in outsourcing.<p>I&#x27;m currently in my senior year but has been struggling to finish my senior project for more than two years already (yes, I&#x27;ve been a senior for that long) because I&#x27;m too afraid to graduate and enter the tech field. I&#x27;m actually losing interest in my project as time goes by and my passion for most things tech-related has been dwindling. Trying to do anything about it just makes me think how much &quot;I hate this work.&quot;<p>Some of my peers in other fields actually say they envy me for choosing this degree because based on their perception, it could lead me to a job that could make me well-off. However, seeing how much work I need to do (i.e. through constant studying and learning) just to have a steady career, it&#x27;s making me question if I really made the right choice in terms of my education and possible career paths. Moreover, I&#x27;m starting to feel the pressure of the job market seeing how more people are entering this field because &quot;this is where the money is.&quot; Not to mention the job cuts I&#x27;ve been hearing about because of global recession.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

A woman was at the front desk very upset about having not been upgraded. She was yelling at the staff and causing a real scene. She left with everyone visibly shaken.  Chatting with them a little after, this sounds like an all too common scene.<p>This morning, as promised, a 1 star rating shows up on every review platform. She claims the hotel is ugly, the staff was rude and racist, and even that someone had pushed her.<p>Everything about this claim is a lie. My partner and have been here 4 days and everything has been fantastic. Every single person on the staff goes out of their way to be helpful and the property is beautiful.<p>Looking more at their reviews online, there are a handful of 1 star reviews with some crazy claims. One even looks to have photoshopped an image to make the pool appear dirty. Almost every 1 star review mentioned not being upgraded.<p>I&#x27;ve become especially sensitive to this after listing a property on Airbnb last year. Almost all guests and reviews are wonderful, thoughtful comments about my home and it&#x27;s location. But then occasionally get a 3 star review with an explanation of something like &quot;the dryer vent had lint in it&quot;. Come on...you&#x27;re staying in a cabin in the woods, not the St Regis.<p>As a business owner and a technologist, I feel a ton of empathy for people that have it all on the line and can be so vulnerable.
