Math Tango (K-3rd)
Beast Academy (K-8th)
Prodigy Game (K-8th) Great for practice, some errors&#x2F;bugs
Dragon Box Algebra<p>Unfortunately, now that are kiddos are at the 9th grade level, the options seem sorely limited.<p>We can&#x27;t really find any great, adaptive math apps for higher level math , that really encourage critical thinking and problem solving.<p>I&#x27;ve scoured the secular homeschool groups on FB and reddit, looked through the app store, asked math teachers, but no luck so far.<p>One of our parents is even thinking of building his own...<p>Wondering if anyone here has tried anything they liked?
