32075715,Enable HTTPS keepAlive in Node.js to increase request speed by up to 70%,2022-07-12T21:08:51Z,gajus,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"No clue how I am learning this only now, but better later than never: HTTPS `keepAlive` is not enabled by default in Node.js, and it has severe performance implications to network-intense applications.<p>Just to illustrate the impact, assuming that your server is hosted in `us-central1` and it is talking to a service in `us-east1`, just the network latency is ~20ms. Since a TCP handshake is a 3-packet event, this means that ~60ms are going to be allocated just to establish TLS handshake.<p>You can test that with a simple script:<p>```ts
const got = require(&#x27;got&#x27;);<p>const main = async () =&gt; {
  const response0 = await got(&#x27;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posthog.com&#x2F;&#x27;);<p><pre><code>  console.log(response0.timings.phases);

  const response1 = await got(&#x27;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;posthog.com&#x2F;&#x27;);

  console.log(response1.timings.phases);</code></pre>
};<p>main();
```<p>In this scenario, the above will produce:<p>```ts
{
  wait: 1,
  dns: 20,
  tcp: 72,
  tls: 74,
  request: 0,
  firstByte: 79,

  tcp: 67,
  tls: 69,
  request: 1,
  firstByte: 73,
  download: 234,
  total: 445
}
```<p>However, watch the `total` time if we enable `keepAlive`:<p>```ts
const got = require(&#x27;got&#x27;);
const https = require(&#x27;https&#x27;);<p>https.globalAgent = new https.Agent({ keepAlive:true });<p>const main = async () =&gt; {
