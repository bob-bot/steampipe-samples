It&#x27;s amazing and shocking how much a cat can kill.<p>We take these creatures, put them in our homes and apartments, and expect them not to destroy things.  When that (predictably) fails, we get them cat toys that they can chase, pounce on, claw, wrestle with, and in the end destroy, so that hopefully they don&#x27;t destroy other things.  (Plus, they can&#x27;t kill the cat toys, but they look <i>so</i> cute while trying to do so.)
