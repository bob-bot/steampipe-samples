I&#x27;m a 49 yo in an emergent economy country. I&#x27;ve been working for 26
years in the same company, a ~200 emp. regional leader in it&#x27;s core
business.<p>Since 2011 I&#x27;ve got a remuneration which is tied to the price of the
base main service the company provides, so my salary has been the same
but my income has increased as the price of this particular service
varied with the years. I&#x27;ve got no other benefits beyond the granted by
working law in this country (vacations, etc.). My salary is roughly
10-12x the base salary of a non-professional employee, and 3x the median
IT &amp; Telco salary in the country, although I live and work on a second
tier city of ~1M people, so perhaps 3.5-4x the median here.<p>The company has grown and expanded it&#x27;s businesses since I&#x27;ve entered
at an early stage and I was instrumental in every aspect of
the company development (modulo finances) implementing most of the
processes and operations that are running the company to this day; for
example, but not limited to: implementation of core technical
procedures, develop of administrative and CRM software, main mission
critical service software, security, communication networks deployment and integration (from analog RF to mesh network), fleet tracking and location (AVL) with driver
registration, maps and dispatch, several
mobile apps for internal use (tech&#x2F;support staff, sales team, etc.),
main app for customers, networking, communications and IT
installations in several buildings, sysadmin, DB admin, a myriad of
other tasks from key strategy and technology selection and deployment
for multi million dollar projects to problem resolution in every
technical concern, while also providing support in a very demanding 24&#x2F;7
environment. Much of this was made by myself up to 2013, since then I&#x27;ve
lead a small team of developers and technical staff. I&#x27;m generally
responsible for the whole operation running smoothly 24&#x2F;7 (main business is 24&#x2F;7 service).<p>I think I&#x27;m not being payed adequately for my work and the value I&#x27;ve
made for the company through the years.  I have a very good and friendly relation with one of the owners (nominally my boss), and I&#x27;m about to open a negotiation with him about
this.<p>I think the company will offer me some money (not more than 10% increase
over my base salary) and some promise for the future tied to some
diffuse and subjective metric of their own, which I will reject as a
matter of course.<p>What do you think will be my best strategy from that point on? It&#x27;s
possible that my strongest point is that there are no one person that
can take over if I left, so they would need to get two to three
people. There are key security implications on this scenario too.<p>I need the work to support my family, and with my savings and my spouse
income I could live perhaps for one to two years educing
our expenditure; there are some difficult decisions to be made in this
regard too, like firing our domestic employee of 12 years, not going on
vacations with the kids, no upgrading our cars or selling some property, etc.<p>I have a little side project but it&#x27;s not enough money and I&#x27;m not sure if it can success.
Thanks a lot.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
