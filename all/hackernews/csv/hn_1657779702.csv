Me having just woken up this moment, I figured i misheard something. I pick up the phone, look at it and hear my name again. This time with a subtle laugh going on in the background. I was shocked, turned off the phone, factory reset just now with a couple of important passwords changed via my laptop.<p>I am not sure why I am posting here, I just needed to vent I guess.
