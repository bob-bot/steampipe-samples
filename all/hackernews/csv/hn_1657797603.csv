I think I do.&quot; and I went looking through boxes.  I opened a box and on top was an Amiga 1200.  Underneath it were two Amiga 1000&#x27;s.<p>I have two Apple 2 computers signed by Steve Wozniak.<p>I&#x27;m conflicted about whether to keep all these machines or not.  On one hand, having them makes me feel good inside at some level.  Howver, I don&#x27;t DO anything with them - they mostly stay in boxes.  Partly this is because I am way too busy doing real world stuff to be fiddling with vintage technology, partly it&#x27;s because I think for me the joy is in the wanting, the finding and the buying.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve developed this habit because as a child in the last 1970&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s we could never afford a computer for many years, when it was something I wanted more than anything in the world.<p>Partly I hold back from selling them because firstly if I regret it then I&#x27;ll never be able to build such a collection again.  Partly I think maybe I&#x27;ll get around to playing with them when (if) I ever &quot;retire&quot;.<p>On the other hand it&#x27;s sort of a burden to have this giant collection of &quot;stuff&quot;.  I don&#x27;t have anywhere nice to display them, and vintage computers need a level of care and attention I just can&#x27;t give.<p>In favor of selling them I would probably get maybe a number of thousand dollars which would help buy a house - something I ned a whole lot more than I need a bunch of vintage computers.<p>I dunno - what do you think HN, sell the collection or keep them?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
