You can think of it as a potentially better, more organised alternative to having a bunch of stuff in random Google Docs and other places that you have to pass back and forth. I also eventually expect to add a lot of automatic post-processing type features (captioning, lighting&#x2F;sound adjustments, &quot;umm&quot; removal, etc.) for people who don&#x27;t know how to do that on their own.<p>Any kind of feedback at all is welcome, positive or negative, on whether there&#x27;s an idea here that you think I could develop into something people would pay for, or if there&#x27;s something you&#x27;d like to see in an app like this.
