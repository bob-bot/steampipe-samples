I used to open a bunch of tabs to apply for jobs that I never ended up applying to bc I was either lazy or it got too messy to keep track of. AKA I never went back to that tab again<p>The job hunt is stressful enough &#x2F; it&#x27;s easy to get discouraged when Chrome loads 50 tabs for LinkedIn and Indeed postings that have expired when you finally get to it. I figured I&#x27;d try to build something to make the process simpler.<p>The extension has really helped me navigate my own job search. (BTW it got approved by the Chrome store yesterday ). I wanted to share it with anyone looking for a simple and beneficial tool.<p>What&#x27;s great about this extension:<p><pre><code>  - It&#x27;s free forever - just trying to help people find a job

  - No sign up needed - works with your Google account

  - Saves job postings directly to Google Sheets

    - You can customize and edit the spreadsheet however you want

  - Integrates with LinkedIn, Indeed and Lever

    - Adds a button on the website - no more switching between tabs or copy&#x2F;paste
</code></pre>
I hope this helps at least a few people with their job search :) If you do try it, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on how it can be improved!",story,https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/resumary-oneclick-save-jo/mkjedhephckpdnpadogmilejdbgbbdfm,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This implies you might have weaknesses in your creation APIs.<p>For instance, suppose you have a fintech application. It does things like records, moves, and so forth. It has portable&#x2F;web UIs for playing out these tasks. You could have tried all the UI ways are simply open to a validated client. Some of the time API endpoint like the one beneath is left unstable on the grounds that without acknowledgment and any programmer&#x2F;bot can get it and consistently make a point to focus on a feed of late exchanges. The best way to fix these sorts of imperfections is to recognize them before they&#x27;re taken advantage of.<p>Example endpoint with the flaw: GET: &#x2F;transactions - Any bot can access it without authentication because it has a broken authentication flaw.<p>One easy way to detect an OWASP API2 vulnerability or security flaw in your APIs is to use open-source tools like Burp and EthicalCheck.

32099618,Show HN: Old News – News that gets better the *less* you read it,2022-07-14T18:18:00Z,mcrowe,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I’ve always wanted a news app designed for people who don’t stay up-to-date daily. That pays attention to when I check-in and what stories I’m aware of and adapts to me. You see, I’m not a good “follower” of the news, and I “catch-up” fairly infrequently. When I do, I want to see the most important things I’ve missed in the meantime, not today’s top stories. I’d like to emerge from my metaphorical cave after a week, a month, or longer, and quickly see what I missed.<p>That’s Old News. I built it for myself, but if you’re like me (statistically, you probably aren’t!) you may like it too. It is quite simple. Swipe to see recommended Hacker News stories and the app keeps track of what you’ve seen. When you come back you’ll see the top stories you haven’t seen yet, with a slow exponential decay of the score over time (a big story from yesterday is still more interesting than one from last month). In the future, I’d love to explore making that decay rate user-configurable so that you can decide how much <i>you</i> prefer newer vs. older news.<p>Interesting for discussion, the app truly does get more useful the <i>less</i> you use it. If you check Hacker News daily, this probably won’t be useful at all! If you are like me, though, value per time used is super high. I’m really keen on this as a concept, and I think it’s worth more developers exploring it. Sure, it’s not great for “engagement” numbers, but I suspect there is a big latent demand for software that actively encourages us to use it less.<p>Download Old News here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oldnews.mitchcrowe.com<p>Caveats:
- iPhone only (sorry!)
- Probably missing features you consider “essential” for a news app (I <i>like</i> simple!)
- No business model, just free hobby software",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
