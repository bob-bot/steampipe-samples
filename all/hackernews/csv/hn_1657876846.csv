Did I throw a wrench into that by choosing an industry gig over a postdoc? 
2. Are there any (recent) examples of research engineers transitioning into a tenured position? 
3. What should I optimize for in my current position to better my odds of achieving that?<p>(I&#x27;m EU based &amp; working for a US company in case it matters.)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The main inspiration was type-ahead search in GUI file managers. There exist several programs that are similar (see the listing in the README), but none of them do it quite the way I like, and often they have a very complex UI and a ton of features. I tried to make something that is obvious how to use and gets out of your way. (I also wanted an excuse to learn Rust.)<p>Let me know what you think!",story,https://github.com/mgunyho/tere,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
