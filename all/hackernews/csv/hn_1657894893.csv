Just google &quot;textbook piracy reddit&quot; and see all the subreddits where people are requesting ebooks.<p>I used to think they download from libgen and sell here for cheap. So I created a fake request and tried to trap some. Turns out THEY HAD THE BOOK THAT I ASKED FOR.<p>Even more surprising thing was the book I was asking them was indian books.<p>1) Even if their university had access to ebooks, having indian ebooks is the least likely thing. (Indian I mean written by Indians not in hindi, related to engineering and cs).<p>2) I then tried IRC chats, to check if the book they got was from there. NOPE.<p>3) It wasn&#x27;t ofc from libgen&#x2F;b-ookzz or whatever it is.<p>4) Not from google search obviously.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;System-Simulation-D-S-Hira-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00QUYL022<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kopykitab.com&#x2F;System-Simulation-Modelling-And-Languages-by-R-Panneerselvam-P-Senthilkumar<p>they had these 2 ebooks but not this one<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.in&#x2F;Modeling-Simulation-Electrical-Engineering-Electronics&#x2F;dp&#x2F;082477812X&#x2F;ref=sr_1_2?qid=1657892419&amp;refinements=p_27%3ANaim+A.+Kheir&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2<p>I am quite surprised what&#x27;s the logic here. I am damn sure they&#x27;re not paying (i.e refunding). The reason is one of them gave the book for me for free. So it suggests that they&#x27;ve the book already with themselves when they told me &quot;I&#x27;ve the book&quot; they had the pdfs. (If they were refunding from amazon, they&#x27;d at least get cash from me and refund from amazon).<p>So, what&#x27;s the catch here? From where are they bringing ebooks that I don&#x27;t know about?<p>I personally always buy physical books but the problem is I&#x27;m from Nepal and there are like 1 indian authored books physical(Our courses are designed according to indian authored textbooks so I prefer them for studying for exams, for learning I prefer American authors)..They say they&#x27;ll bring us the book we request, but that&#x27;ll take 2 months LOL. 1 semester is around 3 months and it&#x27;s not 100% sure if they bring because I&#x27;ve not tried them yet, and Nepalese people are pretty corrupted so unless I give them some money under the table, they won&#x27;t do it.<p>So I need these piracy ebooks. Our teachers are also pretty shitty(as everyone who knows shit and graduates from nepal moves to USA). can anyone tell me how are these people geting these ebooks. When I asked them, they told &quot;I can&#x27;t tell you for some reason&quot;. I guess that they&#x27;re hacking some system&#x2F;abusing some system, but I&#x27;m not sure what they&#x27;re abusing.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
