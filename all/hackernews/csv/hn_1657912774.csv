Wow-oh-wow: no.<p>I&#x27;m currently visiting the parents for a mini-vacation for a couple of weeks. Since I&#x27;m the resident expert, my father asked me for some help with a computer task on his Mac. No problem.<p>In the process of talking him through the issue, I asked him to copy-and-paste some text. He didn&#x27;t understand what I meant. I&#x27;m not talking about not memorizing the keyboard shortcuts, but he was genuinely not understanding what copying and pasting even referred to. He was struggling with the mental concept of selecting and copying text in one program and pasting it for use elsewhere in another program.  Walking him through the process (which I&#x27;m certain he didn&#x27;t really understand) took several frustrating minutes. His best understanding of how to transfer text before this was to save a file in one program and try and open it in another program.<p>My father is not a techie by any means, but he&#x27;s used a computer daily for recreation at least the last 15 years on both Mac and Windows, managed the household technology stuff, and performed normal light office tasks in the course of his work—using the Internet, typing documents, and printing them out.<p>I assume very little from an average user, but this is a hell of a reminder that:<p>* the Least Common Denominator of users still has a minimal understanding of how to use a computer despite actually using it for productive work<p>* don&#x27;t understand the capabilities of their system<p>* feel incredibly frustrated when their UIs change in any way because they work by memorizing how to do tasks, not logical problem solving using their knowledge of the system<p>* most people still need to be protected from themselves and there&#x27;s a reason why by default many UIs are dumbed down to what we think is an absurdly basic level",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Mapedia is a new kind of learning platform at the crossroad between Wikipedia, Google Maps and Khan Academy: a learning map built collaboratively to support online learners to learn any topic seamlessly.<p>We built an interactive learning map of topics to be able to visualize the different fields of knowledge, what concepts are included in them and how they relate to each other. This allows for curiosity based exploration, identifying knowledge gaps (unknown unknowns) and figuring out what to learn next (and in which order).
For each topic you can then find community and expert curated resources, learning advices and smart recommendations in order to learn as efficiently as possible.<p>We want people to spend time learning rather than figuring out how to learn, and in particular to empower self-directed learners. 
The idea came out of the frustration and inefficiency of learning online, and I&#x27;ve been working on it for 2 years now. The vision in itself for it is not so new, Mapedia is rather a different take on it that particularly believes in the potential of crowdsourcing and online communities. Our roadmap includes implementing learning groups based on shared goals rather than shared course&#x2F;learning material, customizable &quot;constructive&quot; feeds of learning materials and adaptive learning paths.<p>The topic map is obviously far from complete and we are still in the early product iterations, but you can checkout a few examples here:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;explore"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;explore</a> -&gt; The explore map from the top level topics<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;explore?selectedTopicId=AvgsEAdEM&amp;mapType=CONCEPTS"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;explore?selectedTopicId=AvgsEAdEM&amp;mapTyp...</a> -&gt; the map focused on functional programming, showing how concepts relate to each other<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;functional_programming_(programming_paradigms)"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;functional_programming_(programmi...</a> -&gt; the  page for the functional programming topic, with curated resources<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;learning_paths&#x2F;learning_how_to_code_only_with_games"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mapedia.org&#x2F;learning_paths&#x2F;learning_how_to_code_only...</a> -&gt; an example of a learning path (this feature is in a very alpha version)<p>Let us know what you think!
