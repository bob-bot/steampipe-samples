Always had too few clothes, which resulted in using the same stuff a lot (with the logical consequences: bad looks and wore down clothes). I think the main problem is that haven&#x27;t put much thought into what to have and what to buy, resulting in buying clothes only for urgent situations.
I&#x27;m moving to NYC in 1 month and would like to have a more logical set of clothes for everyday. I am a man, 32, work in an office every day, casual (I work in tech). Any recommendations? A link to a spreadsheet would be great :)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
