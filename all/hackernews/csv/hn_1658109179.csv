32133392,Why should I relearn algorithms?,2022-07-18T01:12:25Z,why_algorithms,2,false,false,1,[32133527],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I read Dan Luu&#x27;s programming books page recently, on which it says about algorithms: &quot;Why should you care? Well, there&#x27;s the pragmatic argument: even if you never use this stuff in your job, most of the best paying companies will quiz you on this stuff in interviews. On the non-bullshit side of things, I find algorithms to be useful in the same way I find math to be useful. The probability of any particular algorithm being useful for any particular problem is low, but having a general picture of what kinds of problems are solved problems, what kinds of problems are intractable, and when approximations will be effective, is often useful.&quot;<p>I learned algorithms in college, many years ago. I still have a good idea of when to use data structures, generally. I probably couldn&#x27;t pass a FAANG-style interview without a couple months prep now, despite giving them every other week. I couldn&#x27;t tell you when to use a red-black tree over a b-tree anymore. Frankly, as a dime-a-dozen megacorp SWE, that&#x27;s not really something that would come up in daily work. IME, management isn&#x27;t going to give you time to care about performance specifics - maybe, if there&#x27;s a library that offers a convenient API and some deceptive benchmark graphs, you use that. I think I&#x27;ve used a prefix trie, once, in my entire professional career. The rest is just standardlib abstractions where I don&#x27;t really care about what&#x27;s happening below. Someone much smarter than me is making optimizations based on the latest papers for any given sorted() implementation.<p>What other motivation is there to relearn algorithms except for clearing the interview hurdle? Especially when free time is limited, and you could instead _finally_ get around to reading Designing Data-Intensive Application or Crafting Interpreters, learning Rust&#x2F;Go&#x2F;CultLang, or dipping your toes into something &quot;fun&quot; like reverse engineering?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
