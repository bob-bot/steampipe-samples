But it&#x27;s my brain, so, can I use them?<p>Even tonight I dreamt of a cool service that I can create in a few hours in React, but am I allowed?<p>I didn&#x27;t come up with it myself just my brain in the dream, so I&#x27;m afraid of copyright.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

However, I&#x27;m the only one in the family that is willing to learn such tools.<p>I&#x27;ve used paid solutions, hated some and loved others. Lunch money was amazing. But my workflow with Hledger still brings back fond memories. With our next child due in 5 weeks I&#x27;m setting up our new budget and want to return to plain text accounting.<p>There are some missing features with Hledger. My wife would like to see how much remains in each category. Preferably via mobile phone.<p>Using plain text tools means I&#x27;m restricting data entry to me. It would be ideal if my wife could have a user friendly interface, but not essential.<p>I&#x27;m hoping some of you run similar setups and might have some suggestions.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It adapts to your preferred design tools, tech stack, and workflows with ease and lets you launch upto 4x faster, while letting designers design the way they want and giving high-quality responsive code that developers love.<p>With this launch, you can convert your Figma designs into React, React Native, Next.js, Gatsby, and HTML-CSS code. You get a live-responsive prototype that runs on code (we call these ‘real-fidelity prototypes’) and when good to go, you can either export the code to build on top of it or directly deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or Github.<p>Today, we have also launched on Product Hunt.
