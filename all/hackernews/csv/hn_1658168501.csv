Given the impact of the public health emergency, the Internet Archive decided to ease its book lending restrictions and allow multiple people to check out the same digital copy of a book at once.<p>&gt; Up to that point, the Internet Archive had established a practice of purchasing copies of printed books, digitizing them and lending them to borrowers one at a time. When it kicked-off the emergency lending program, the Internet Archive made it clear that this policy would be in effect until the end of the pandemic. Furthermore, the archive’s publishers said that this program was in response to library doors being closed to the public during the pandemic. Under conditions where the Internet Archive was the only means of access to titles for many people, the policy was justified and a creative response to COVID-19.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

TiddlyWiki loses some points on hackability because it&#x27;s web technology and fairly sandboxed. Vim&#x2F;Emacs are only for text, obviously. I think what these tools have in common is that they all have a strong core idea (Vim: modal, TiddlyWiki: a quine of tiddlers, Emacs: elisp) that provides insane feature breadth at relatively low cost to learnability.<p>Other software is usually on a spectrum of low feature count (most tools in the UNIX philosophy) to low understandability (IDEs, most other text editors, all OSes). Then a few rare ones are extremely powerful, but so old and poorly designed that I don&#x27;t think they make the cut (e.g. Bash in my opinion).<p>Are there other tools similar to Vim, that maybe even cover other application areas?
