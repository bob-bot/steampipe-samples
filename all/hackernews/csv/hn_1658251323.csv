My primary email is MyName@gmail.com. I&#x27;ve occasionally gotten email intended for others with my name, until now it has never been an issue.<p>Then someone that shares my name created an account and used my email address as the primary email. At the time I didn&#x27;t think anything of it, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to validate the address and would correct that. That correction never happened and now I&#x27;m receiving email with all of their account activity. Failed login attempts, receipts, updated credit card info, iCal invitations for upcoming events that they&#x27;ve joined. Some of this is quite personal, I shouldn&#x27;t be seeing this.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about the person that shares my name so I don&#x27;t have a way of contacting them directly. There is no unsubscribe because this isn&#x27;t opt-in email. I tried marking the email as spam, but somehow it started showing in my account again.<p>A month ago I contacted their support and asked that my email be removed. They couldn&#x27;t help me. Their support team sent instructions for how to change an email address or how to recover an account, but neither of these solutions apply in my case.<p>Now I seem to be stuck, once their team realized that I&#x27;m not their customer they stopped replying. I tried logging into the account to take it over and change the address myself, but they have 2FA enabled so this wasn&#x27;t possible. Meanwhile my phone has started automatically adding their iCal invites to my calendar so I just got a notification to appear at the other person&#x27;s hotel.<p>How can I get my email address removed from an account that belongs to someone else?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
