This let me and my partner just type in the website name and be in the same call during work or at home. We basically just streamed what we do and chatted when bored. Now it&#x27;s used by many other couples in LDR.<p>Unfortunately, recently we parted ways with my partner. But since then we started to use the site with my 2 co-founders as we work from different cities. It makes it super easy to ask spontaneous questions and be in sync during the day.<p>If you are a remote founding team it might be helpful for you as well.<p>You can check it out here: livelink.live - only works on desktop for now<p>(Ignore the copy, it&#x27;s completely optimized for relationships haha)<p>Let me know what you think.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
