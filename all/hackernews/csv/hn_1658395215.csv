So I made a Web App which will list all of your tenant devices still using legacy protocols and how to move them to modern authentication:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;betterlicenses.com&#x2F;audit_log<p>I also document on a blog post how this can be retrieved for free using existing Azure AD sign in logs, but it&#x27;s not as easy to understand and my Web App will send you a daily notification whenever a new device is found using basic authentication.<p>Used Stripe to receive payments and the app has been running for a month and half. It&#x27;s on a subscription bases only for 20 days because the first 2 weeks it was free and a lot of users were using it and my server costs exploded due to having to analyse a lot of log entries.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
