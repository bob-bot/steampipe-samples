A number of members of your workspace were inadvertently included on the same email. This means that you&#x27;re able to see each other&#x27;s email addresses in the “To” line. You are receiving this notice because you were sent this email on July 19 or July 20, 2022.<p>What happened and when?
Slack emailed members of your workspace about the upcoming changes to Slack’s free plan with the subject line “New features coming to your Slack workspace.” Instead of sending each workspace member individual emails as intended, the email recipients on your team were visible in the same email message.<p>Slack identified this problem and immediately took steps to stop additional emails from being sent in this way. We&#x27;re also reaching out to inform all users who received the email. All of the content of the email is still accurate for your team.<p>How was I impacted?
Since you received one of these emails, this means that other people on your workspace who received the email may have inadvertently seen your email address.<p>What should I do?
We ask that you delete and not share, store, print, or in any way retain the original email with email addresses. If you have additional questions about this, you can reply to this email, or reach out to us at feedback@slack.com.<p>We know that the security and privacy of your data is important. We are very sorry for the inconvenience and concern this issue may have caused.<p>Sincerely,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons.<p>2 years ago, I joined a startup as a Data Scientist as employee ~10. My base salary was in the mid-100s and I negotiated ~0.25% equity stake of a company valued at ~$10M at the seed stage. (Should have negotiated much more, but hindsight is 20&#x2F;20.)<p>Fast forward to today – the company is valued at $500M+ post-Series B, and my equity stake has been diluted to ~0.06%. Turns out that multiple convertible notes hit when the company raised a Series A and I was severely diluted. Employees who joined ~1 year after I did at the same level received 2-4x as many options, albeit with a much higher strike price.<p>I believe that this company will 10-20x and IPO within the next 4 years. But I also know that is far from a certainty.<p>1. Does it make sense to try to re-negotiate my equity comp, or should I just get a new job?<p>2.
