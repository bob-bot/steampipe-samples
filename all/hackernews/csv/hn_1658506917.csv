Or maybe things are divided into key classes A, B and C, each of which encapsulates a self-contained piece of functionality. It&#x27;s possible for A or B to fail without affecting C. If B crashes, you know it is due to a problem with some particular feature. It&#x27;s all quite sensible and easy to reason about.<p>Then, later, after go-live... a new, unrelated major feature D is added. Instead of creating a new backend server or class to implement D, it is shoe-horned into the existing A&#x2F;B&#x2F;C backend server or classes or whatever. And then feature, E, feature F, etc... all shoehorned into whatever the original architecture &#x2F; components were, instead of adding dedicated new components for D and E and F, just like happened for A&#x2F;B&#x2F;C.<p>Obviously, over time, this just leads to a big mess. Not only do you not end up with a dedicated, self-contained implementation for D, you also destroy the dedicated, self-contained components you originally had for A&#x2F;B&#x2F;C in the process, and after a bit of time it turns into a big unstructured mess.<p>I always find this kind of bizarre, because often the original structure is pretty sensible, and all that&#x27;s required is to continue applying the same reasoning and techniques to new features as was applied to the original ones.<p>Sometimes there are administrative disincentives that encourage this, like requiring some onerous approval for a &quot;new&quot; server &#x2F; class &#x2F; source file, but a lightweight process for a &quot;change&quot; to an existing thing... but for the most part it just seems to be odd that people can&#x27;t apply more of what&#x27;s already in front of them, instead of destroying it.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

What a nightmare that was.<p>What got me excited was the 30 minutes of our last lecture where the teacher talked about client-side rendering using jQuery + external APIs. According to him, it was a fly that will be forgotten in a year or two. For me it was what got me hooked on web development.<p>I then worked at multiple companies doing server-side rendering to get around the problem slow clients. That made a lot of sense back in the day.<p>The move towards static-site generation(SSG) also made a lot of sense and felt like a fresh breath of air after years of slow and uncached wordpress sites taking over the web.<p>But now, 10 years later, I feel like I am seeing the whole industry loop around with the recent move on rendering everything on the edge aka. Edge-Side Rendering(ESR).<p>I get it, faster websites, more money. It is also more inclusive for users with slower devices. But I&#x27;d argue that the decentralization of computation by devices own by users is better than moving towards centralization of this computation.<p>So for me, the elephant in the room is how this new revenue stream is being created by cloud providers and how they push us toward SSG and ESR.  
Promoting it as a holly grail when SSG and ISG would suffice for the majority of use cases and eventually save everybody a lot of money.<p>What am I missing?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
