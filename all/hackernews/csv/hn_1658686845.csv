The interviewer will often not give specific answers to your questions at all, so you have to make up your own answers, and then build on those.<p>For whatever reason, my questions, answers, and plans (most of which come from my real life experience) dont seem to be satisfactory.<p>How do I do better at these?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
