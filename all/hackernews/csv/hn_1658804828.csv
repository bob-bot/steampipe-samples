Unfortunately as a two person company, keeping track of all the programs&#x27; statuses is hard.<p>Is there a way to keep track (and if possible, also spawn them on schedule) of the processes and give regular updates?

I built a web app to plan with friends and now it&#x27;s in a beta release. All with the goal of making planning travel with friends easier.<p>You can create itineraries through an intuitive calendar interface. Saving all the important information about each destination&#x2F;event in you trip you can access while planning and while on the trip.<p>Trips cost money, unfortunately, but you can track and maintain your trip budget. Track who&#x27;s paid and who hasn&#x27;t. Make settling the tab super easy.<p>One of the hardest parts of trip planning is figuring out what to do or where to stay. Not everyone is always up for the same thing. Use the vote&#x2F;like button on events to help make group decisions about the trip.<p>And so much more to come!<p>Thanks for checking out Plan Harmony.
