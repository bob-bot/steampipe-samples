Marple helps them organize and analyze their sensor data in a more user-friendly way.<p>We’ve all been there: measurement data from an experiment or test needs to be analyzed but the only thing you have is a few data files flying around. You do not have a clue how to open or read the data. So what you do next is open your Python&#x2F;Matlab&#x2F;Jupyter Notebook&#x2F;… and start coding in order to make some sense of the data. We didn’t like that process, so we started Marple to solve this issue.<p>Engineers tend to log data at frequencies from 1Hz to 10kHz and usually log hundreds of sensors at the same time. Data sets usually contain millions of data points. In order to make our web-based data visualization responsive, we had some technical challenges to tackle. We developed our own visualization engine based on PostgreSQL that is able to visualize millions of data points pretty much instantly. This allows us to create an interactive visualization environment which is perfect for data exploration, even for large data sets!<p>This is the second time we show Marple to HackerNews, but since then we made some big steps. We made a pivot to a cloud product and now offer a free version of Marple. Feel free to head over to our website and give it a go. Let us know what you think of it!",story,https://www.marpledata.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32235801,Show HN: I embedded a book search into Notion,2022-07-26T08:38:48Z,RBouschery,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN!<p>(Full transparency: I&#x27;ve not been a very active member of this community (yet). But I want to change that and thought it could be a good start to showcase a project that I&#x27;ve built recently.)<p>I read a lot of books and always loved having some sort of digital bookshelf where I could easily keep track of books that were recommended to me, keep all of my notes &amp; highlights and share what I&#x27;m reading with friends.<p>For the past 10 years, I&#x27;ve used Goodreads for this. But I became more and more frustrated with it - Amazon seems to mostly neglect it. At the same time, I started using Notion to organize pretty much everything else in my life.<p>I saw how other people organized their books and reading lists in Notion but I felt it was a burden to manually transfer all of the book data.<p>That&#x27;s why I built a little app that&#x27;s embedded into a Notion template to provide a book search natively inside of it. Now you can search for, and add any book to your Notion bookshelf without leaving the app and with no manual data entry. I also built an importer to transfer all Goodreads data to Notion (including beautiful book covers) with the click of a button.<p>You can check out my digital bookshelf here:
