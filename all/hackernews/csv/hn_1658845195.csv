32238362,Show HN: Multy – open-source tool to deploy to any cloud and switch at any time,2022-07-26T13:59:38Z,danvdb18,4,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"We have been working on Multy, an open-source[1] tool that enables developers to deploy and switch to any cloud - AWS, Azure and GCP for now.<p>We realized that, even when using Terraform, writing infrastructure code is very different for each cloud provider. This means changing clouds or deploying the same infrastructure in multiple clouds requires rewriting the same thing multiple times. And even though most core resources have the same functionality, developers need to learn a new provider and all its nuances when choosing a new cloud. This is why we built Multy.<p>Multy is currently available as a Terraform provider. You can write cloud-agnostic code and then just choose which cloud you want to deploy to. Multy will then call the cloud provider APIs on your behalf. For example, the following Terraform code deploys a virtual network in AWS and can be easily changed to deploy to Azure or GCP:<p>resource &quot;multy_virtual_network&quot; &quot;vn&quot; {<p><pre><code>  cloud      = &quot;aws&quot; &#x2F;&#x2F; or azure, or gcp

  name       = &quot;multy_vn&quot;
  cidr_block = &quot;10.0.0.0&#x2F;16&quot;
  location   = &quot;eu_west_1&quot;</code></pre>
}<p>Our goal is to expose any configuration that is common across all clouds, but there’s always specific features that are not available in all of them. For example, if you want a very specific AWS CPU for your Virtual Machine or use a region that is only available in GCP. To enable this, we implemented overrides [2] - a way to configure the underlying infrastructure for cloud-specific purposes. You can also mix other Terraform code that uses the cloud-specific providers with Multy. While this makes you somewhat locked in, having your 80% or 90% of your infrastructure  cloud-agnostic is still very powerful.<p>You can see more complex examples in our documentation - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.multy.dev&#x2F;examples&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.multy.dev&#x2F;examples&#x2F;</a>.<p>We’re still in early days and looking for feedback from other developers on our approach.

It&#x27;s like Wordle, but with a twist - you have to guess words with higher semantic score (closest in meaning) to find the hidden word.<p>What is semantic and example?
Semantics is the study of meaning in language. It can be applied to entire texts or to single words. For example, &quot;destination&quot; and &quot;last stop&quot; technically mean the same thing, but students of semantics analyze their subtle shades of meaning.<p>How to Play
~ Guess the hidden word in 20 tries.
~ One hint word is provided at the start of game to get you started.
~ Each guess must be a valid English word. Hit the enter button to submit.
~ For each guess, a semantic similarity score shows how close your guess was to the hidden word.
~ Use additional 4 hints as needed.<p>Challenge and fun aspects 
~ The game uses GPT-3 APIs from OpenAI to compute the dynamic semantic score for each guess word. The hints too are generated dynamically using GPT-3 prompts.
~ There are infinite paths to successfully completing the game. As such, the game play is unique to each player.
~ The game play allows implicit multiple strategies for players to discover and apply.
~ The skill is to use limited hints, and guess words with higher semantic score to reach the goal.
~ The game score can be computed and shared based on combination of number of tries and hints used (not yet implemented in beta).<p>This is currently in beta and I would love to get constructive feedback. So go ahead and give it a try - and feel free to share it with friends!<p><a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;167.71.1.193&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;167.71.1.193&#x2F;</a><p>Cheers!
