32242160,Ask HN: Are Large Language Models Like GPT-3 a Hype?,2022-07-26T18:40:15Z,behnamoh,2,false,false,1,[32242326],<null>,<null>,<null>,"LLMs keep getting bigger and bigger, but I still don&#x27;t understand the value they provide to businesses and individuals. There must be a reason for MS to purchase the GPT-3 license for $1b, and Meta, Google, OpenAI, etc. wouldn&#x27;t spend millions of dollars just to train these huge models. Yet, I don&#x27;t get it.<p>IMO, &quot;AI through API&quot; is a bad practice that sets a wrong precedence for the incoming AGI. It&#x27;s basically a black box wrapped around another black box. In addition, the cost of GPT-3 and other models may be prohibitive for small businesses and startups.<p>What is going on here? I see some similar patterns between LLMs and cryptocurrencies: both are super hot and receive billions of dollars, but neither has proven its use cases.
