My family and I have been long-term customers of theirs so that&#x27;s how this came about.<p>Now it seems like a very, very common theme among freelancers - I&#x27;ve read this over and over again in many different places and from people of various fields - that thinking back to their first customer they believe they massively undersold their services.<p>The naive fool that I am I would like to try and avoid that &quot;mistake&quot; while also not wanting to appear like I&#x27;m only out for the money (which I&#x27;m not). My focus is obviously first and foremost to deliver a top-notch service but I would also like to get the pricing right. So how do I go about doing that? I am in Germany if it matters.<p>My own idea so far is to say my work is worth 40€&#x2F;hour and it will take me maybe 40 hours to do the job so 40€*40 = 1600€. Then I&#x27;d give like a 25% discount as a gesture of friendship and make it 1200€ but doesn&#x27;t that still seem ... like a bit too much? Or am I falling for that trap... ?

32244691,Ask HN: How to avoid patent infringement/patent trolls?,2022-07-26T22:06:00Z,ditherblur,1,false,false,2,"[32244823,32244800]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"I know, IANAL&#x2F;get a lawyer but I&#x27;m a poor solo dev in the US trying to bootstrap, those overhead costs are just too much when talking to an IP attorney can go for $200+ an hour. It seems that all my peers never worry about patents but every time I&#x27;m on HN, I always read horror stories that leave me anxious. Most of the cases seem to have a good ending but they always seem to take years like that GNOME patent troll case.<p>What are the best practices to avoid patent infringement&#x2F;being a target of a patent troll?<p>I been reading lots of NOLO law books, I got 10 books from the library right now about IP law, Patent, Copyright, how to do Legal Research and so on. I know there stuff like EFF https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org to help. There&#x27;s Google Patent or USPTO search to look for prior art and stuff from 20 years ago is expiring* (I know it&#x27;s not that simple but just want to be brief).<p>But I just feel anxious about the whole thing, it really has made me stop coding&#x2F;sharing code&#x2F;building stuff. It&#x27;s just so time consuming when the old me would just jump into a fresh project and just start building instead. I see my old friends from college blatantly copying UI designs when they don&#x27;t realize most of them are under Design Patents and they&#x27;re at risk. Maybe I&#x27;m being dramatic but it seems that patent trolls are on the rise against even small players, so many new software patents are being filed at a rate more than you can reasonable keep up with, and in the coming recession it might be even more profitable to be litigious against small time devs. It feels like a necessity to cover your bases while you can.<p>I know there&#x27;s no way to be completely safe, but there must be a some approach to at least reduce the majority of your risk. To do things the right way. What should a dev do to reduce their risk? (Right now I&#x27;m reading into Single Member LLCs so that I could offset the risk to that in case of a lawsuit but I&#x27;m just learning stuff right now, everything is fuzzy and more complicated than I can try to describe in a few paragraphs).<p>&quot;That reminds me to remark, in passing, that the very first official thing I did, in my administration-and it was on the first day of it, too-was to start a patent office; for I knew that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was just a crab, and couldn&#x27;t travel any way but sideways or backways.&quot;
—Mark Twain<p>It just feels like it&#x27;d be easier to just give up building software but it shouldn&#x27;t feel like that, I thought the patent laws were to promote the drive to pursue innovation.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
