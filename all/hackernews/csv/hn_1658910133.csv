I doubt &quot;Magda&quot;, &quot;Peter&quot;, &quot;Rick&quot;, &quot;Toby&quot; and the rest of the bunch actually exist, obviously. This tiny store would have dozens of employees on one hour work shift each just for e-mail replies.<p>Is this a known automated service offered by Amazon to small businesses to &quot;personalize&quot; replies ?
