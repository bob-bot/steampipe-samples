32250290,Ask HN: Does hashing only part of a file make sense as unique checksum?,2022-07-27T13:42:32Z,sandreas,1,false,false,1,[32250461],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN,<p>currently, I&#x27;m having a performance issue with my little side project `tonehub`[1]. It&#x27;s a small Web API including a background indexer task for audio files in pretty early state.<p>Introduction: Sometimes I move an audio file to another directory, because the metadata changed. This results in losing all of the files non-metadata history (playback count, current position, playlists, etc.).<p>To overcome this, I implemented hashing via xxhash only for the audio-part of the file skipping the metadata part. If a file is indexed, but its location is not found in the database, it hashes the file, looks it up and if a unique match is present, it updates only the location keeping the history and releations.<p>Now to my problem: It&#x27;s too slow. I have many audio book files in m4b format, most of the time bigger than 200MB and hashing a file like this takes pretty long, long enough that indexing a whole library feels to slow in my opinion.<p>So I thought about following alternatives to improve that:<p><pre><code>  - Hashing only a fixed length part of of the file (e.g. 5MB around the midpoint position, because of intros and outros are often the same)
  
  - Hashing a percentage size part (e.g. 5% of the audio data size)
  
  - Combine one of these &quot;partial&quot; hashes with a size check (e.g. hash=0815471 + size=8340485bytes, because hash and size collision may be less likely)?
</code></pre>
It feels like that won&#x27;t work. So I ask HN:<p><pre><code>  Would one of these alternatives be enough to avoid collisions? 

  If so, what would be a &quot;sufficient&quot; part of the file and which alternative is the best?
</code></pre>
