I&#x27;ve identified the apps that I use 90%-95% of the time and feel like I have good alternatives for them, with the exception of one. I will be using Linux mainly with a graphical interface, so that I can be pretty much up-to-speed from day one. As a dev&#x2F;consultant in the Windows world, my main apps are a browser, a good code editor, remote desktop (mostly to Windows servers), FTP&#x2F;SFTP, email, and common Office-related stuff (Excel, Word, Powerpoint). I think I&#x27;ve figured out substitutions for everything except the email client. Right now I use Postbox, which is great and generally meets my needs, but they do not have a Linux version. My big stumbling block for email seems to be that I tend to keep ALL emails forever, and I need to have a decent search. I also have around 15-20 different email accounts that I monitor at all times. My email storage footprint is currently around the 25GB range. Some email clients simply cannot deal with the sheer number of emails and size of data in this scenario. At the moment, I am thinking that Thunderbird might be my only option, but I used it (long ago) and seem to recall that it got slower and slower when dealing with so much data. Maybe that aspect has improved, but does anybody have recommendations for a graphical email client for Linux that can handle these requirements?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
