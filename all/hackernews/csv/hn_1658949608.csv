Close to being able to retire, but not quite there yet. I&#x27;m bored. I&#x27;ve done a bit of everything at this point, and it&#x27;s starting to feel tedious. I don&#x27;t care about title&#x2F;level anymore. With various market meltdowns, the golden handcuffs are feeling less binding, and I&#x27;m feeling a bit more free to make choices career-wise, since at this point I&#x27;m fortunate in that I only really need to cross the finish line so to speak. I have no desire to leave software development - I&#x27;m not going to become a woodworker or teacher. After I retire I will still code as one of my main hobbies. But everywhere I look, it all seems very &quot;been there, done that.&quot; I&#x27;ve reinvented myself several times over my career (domain-wise) and I think I&#x27;m quite malleable in that regard, but the intrinsic motivation is waning after decades of enthusiasm.
