I had requested they waive their fees, as I believed the information requested was in the public interest (&quot;When Login.gov existed, why is the Social Security Administration not using Login.gov versus having a private contract with ID.me?&quot;) I was told they would not waive their fees, as I had not demonstrated releasing this information was in the public interest. I appealed, and recently received a response [2] that they were invoking 42 USC §1106(c) of the Social Security Act [3]:<p>&quot;(c) Notwithstanding sections 552 and 552a of title 5, United States Code[11], or any other provision of law, whenever the Commissioner of Social Security or the Secretary determines that a request for information is made in order to assist a party in interest (as defined in section 3 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974[12] (29 U.S.C. 1002)) with respect to the administration of an employee benefit plan (as so defined), *or is made for any other purpose not directly related to the administration of the program or programs under this Act to which such information relates*, such Commissioner or Secretary may require the requester to pay the full cost, as determined by the such Commissioner or Secretary, of providing such information.&quot;<p>(emphasis mine)<p>I&#x27;m unsure if the above section was invoked due to the House Committee on Oversight and Reform currently investigating ID.me [4] [5], or if invoking this clause is legitimate for such a request. I believed when making the request that this was very much in the public interest.<p>If I want to continue with this information request, it will cost me about $3,000 in FOIA search fees [6]. I&#x27;m not asking for funds, but rather to seek feedback if continuing on this endeavor might surface material information on the topic that is in the public interest.<p>Thank you for your time.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;z3nqy9&#x2F;irs-stop-id-me-facial-recognition<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.muckrock.com&#x2F;foi&#x2F;united-states-of-america-10&#x2F;idme-documents-and-data-social-security-administration-122226&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;22077251&#x2F;ssa-2022-004211-final-fee-waiver-appeal-response-letter-7-1-22.pdf<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ssa.gov&#x2F;OP_Home&#x2F;ssact&#x2F;title11&#x2F;1106.htm<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;epic.org&#x2F;congress-begins-investigation-into-face-verification-vendor-id-me&#x2F;<p>[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oversight.house.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;democrats.oversight.house.gov&#x2F;files&#x2F;2022-04-14.CBM%20JEC%20to%20Hall-ID.me%20re%20Use%20of%20FRT.pdf<p>[6] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;22120983&#x2F;ssa-2022-003354-gallbraith-fee-notice.pdf",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
