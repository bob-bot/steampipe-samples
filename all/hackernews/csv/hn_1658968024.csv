If you execute the &quot;foo hosts&quot; command, (it may asks for root passwd) the following happens: mv &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts ~&#x2F;.foo&#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts, and link it back to its original place + write info about the files into a text based config file like ~&#x2F;.foo&#x2F;config.yaml<p>4. You can push all of it into git<p>5. Pull the configs into a new machine, and based on the config.yaml file &quot;foo&quot; can restore the desidred dot&#x2F;config files<p>The important thing here is I dont have to edit config files manually while I can save&#x2F;restore config files from anywhere on my system.
