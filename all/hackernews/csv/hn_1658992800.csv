The various elements in the value chain adjust their prices to make a living margin, this drives the final &quot;retail&quot; price, the government collect taxes, etc...<p>Now, for some reason, the shirt is picked by a modestly famous internet celebrity. Suddenly, copies of the shirt are sought out everywhere, and some seller is incentivized to bring the _retail price_ up. More money exchange hands. More taxes are levied.<p>Naively, it seems like this &quot;value&quot; was created out of &quot;thin air (the shirt is not any warmer or resistant or durable or anything tangible).<p>Is there a name for this kind of &quot;value&quot; ?
