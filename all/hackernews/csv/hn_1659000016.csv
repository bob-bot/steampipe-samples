Marple was created by engineers for engineers. Marple helps them organize and analyze their sensor data in a more user-friendly way.<p>We’ve all been there: measurement data from an experiment or test needs to be analyzed but the only thing you have is a few data files flying around. You do not have a clue how to open or read the data. So what you do next is open your Python&#x2F;Matlab&#x2F;Jupyter Notebook&#x2F;… and start coding in order to make some sense of the data. We didn’t like that process, so we started Marple to solve this issue.<p>Engineers tend to log data at frequencies from 1Hz to 10kHz and usually log hundreds of sensors at the same time. Data sets usually contain millions of data points. In order to make our web-based data visualization responsive, we had some technical challenges to tackle. We developed our own visualization engine based on PostgreSQL that is able to visualize millions of data points pretty much instantly. This allows us to create an interactive visualization environment which is perfect for data exploration, even for large data sets!<p>This is the second time we show Marple to HackerNews, but since then we made some big steps. We made a pivot to a cloud product and now offer a free version of Marple. Feel free to head over to our website and give it a go. Let us know what you think of it!",story,https://www.marpledata.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
