Over the past few days I&#x27;ve been sitting in on their daily standups and attending various project meetings, getting a feel for the group and the status of ongoing work.<p>It&#x27;s become apparent to me that one of the developers is a prima donna.  He&#x27;s been with the team for about a year, and during that time he&#x27;s virtually rewritten every project he&#x27;s worked on (because the old codebase was trash, of course), he resists learning anything about the other technologies in his projects&#x27; tech stacks, and his views on customer feature requests are utterly binary (&quot;easy&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot;).<p>The developer really is talented, for those technologies in his wheelhouse.  He is probably the best developer in that group and I can see why his current manager hired him.  However, the friction is ... considerable.<p>I&#x27;ve read many articles and blogs about handling prima donnas on a dev team.  Some of those were good, some less so.<p>HN, what is your experience?
