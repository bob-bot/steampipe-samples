His instructions were pretty much spot on but I do have a few comments:<p>1. Suggest creating boot USB first.  It takes a while and you can be doing other things while that is going on.<p>2. Had trouble getting Ctrl D to work on my keyboard.  Finally figured out I need to use a different (wired) keyboard.<p>3. Had trouble figuring out &quot;-LO&quot; in the the series of inputs while in text mode of Linux. To be clear the &quot;O&quot; is a capital &quot;oh&quot;, not a zero as I had initially surmised.  Always have trouble with that.  And you can use the enter key between the three commands even though the instructions in  MrChromebox.Tech say to only hit enter after third line is typed in.<p>3. I had to stop what I was doing overnight and reboot the next day and it seemed to me that the second time around the Ctrl D didn&#x27;t work (even with the wired keyboard) but then it went into recovery mode anyway.<p>4. Some of the screens that came up were slightly different than what was described but I was able to figure it out.<p>5. The Chromebox works great now but the process is made a bit difficult because Google write protects these boxes and doesn&#x27;t allow it&#x27;s original firmware to boot from USB.  So the hard part here is getting around all that.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It struck me how difficult it was to do things like:<p>- Make an animation performant (lots of CSS properties trigger paint or layout unexpectedly)
- Make components with good keyboard accessibility (not just tabbing), common mobile gesture support, etc.
- Do styling properly (CSS modules aren&#x27;t quite cutting it, and on the perf side sometimes recalculating styles takes up to 50ms!)<p>I&#x27;d particular like to improve the performance story in the frontend world but I&#x27;d be interested in creating or contributing to anything (build tools, libraries, linters, etc.) that makes it easier for devs to make a nice user experience. I was going to experiment a bit myself with things like shadow DOM, wasm, and web workers to see if those things might be suitable for the mainstream web (for wasm we have yew, for example, but it&#x27;s niche). I thought that first, I should get the opinion of web devs more experienced than myself.<p>To repeat the title question: What does the frontend dev world need to make better applications?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
