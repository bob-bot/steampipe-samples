It would be specifically targeted at non-technical founders with no prior programming experience.<p>Ruby on Rails happens to be among the most popular programming frameworks for building web apps in startups because of its extensive ecosystem and the tooling out of the box.<p>Typical beginner books on programming — and programming with Ruby and Ruby on Rails specifically — are oriented at a general audience. But building an MVP or a PoC is a completely different story: you&#x27;ve got to be extremely pragmatic in your choice of tools, libraries and their use. You must know the easiest, scalable way of running your SaaS on the Internet. You don&#x27;t have to know or understand a lot of things which are only useful to a general programmer: like performance or writing &quot;beautiful&quot; code. All you need is to know just enough and in just the right combination to be able to deliver the first versions of the product. If it shows a promise - you can find a technical co-founder, or hire a freelancer to develop it further properly.<p>A little bit about me: I have 12+ years of working as a software engineer in startups of various sizes, most of which were built using Ruby on Rails.<p>I was part of small teams getting an MVP ready, mid-sized teams within successful startups with multiple rounds of investments behind, as well as a company of 1000+ engineers running some of the biggest Ruby on Rails apps out there.<p>Recently, I&#x27;ve also guided a (non-technical) friend in building an MVP, and it was quite illuminating for both of us. That&#x27;s how I got the idea to scale it out in form of a course, or a book.<p>That said, I am not sure if there would be a demand for such a course. Maybe I am overestimating the need for it, and non-technical founders prefer spending their time somewhere else, instead.<p>What are your thoughts?<p>Thank you.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32269722,Show HN: TensorDock Core GPU Cloud – GPU servers from $0.29/hr,2022-07-28T20:28:47Z,jonathanlei,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello HN!<p>I’m Jonathan from TensorDock. After 7 months in beta, we’re finally launching Core Cloud, our platform to deploy GPU virtual machines in as little as 45 seconds!  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tensordock.com&#x2F;product-core"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tensordock.com&#x2F;product-core</a><p>Why? 
Training machine learning workloads at large clouds can be extremely expensive. This left us wondering, “how did cloud ever become more expensive than on-prem?” I’ve seen too many ML startups buy their own hardware. Cheaper dedicated servers with NVIDIA GPUs are not too hard to find, but they lack the functionality and scalability of the big clouds.<p>We thought to ourselves, what if we built a platform that combines the functionality of the large clouds but made it priced somewhere between a dedicated server and the large clouds? That’s exactly what we’ve done.<p><pre><code>  Built to make engineers more productive
 - 3 machine learning images so you can start training ML models in 2 minutes, not 2 hours
 - We provide a REST API, so you can integrate directly your code with ours
 - There’s also a community CLI you can use to manage your servers directly via command line

 The feature set only large clouds can match
 - Storage-only billing when the VM is stopped (for only $0.073&#x2F;GB&#x2F;month) 
 - Edit virtual machines after they’re created to downsize costs. If you provision a NVIDIA A6000 and find out you’re only using 50% of it, stop the VM, modify it to a NVIDIA A5000, and you’ll be billed the lower hourly rate without needing to recreate your server and migrate data over! 
 - 3x-replicated NVMe-based network storage. Seriously fast
 - 10 Gbps networking
 - 3 locations (New York, Chicago, Las Vegas), and more coming soon! 
 - Custom alerts
 - Billing pro-rated to the minute

 How cheap are we? 
 - CPU-only servers from $0.027&#x2F;hour
 - NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000s from $0.29&#x2F;hour
 - NVIDIA Tesla V100s from $0.52&#x2F;hour</code></pre>
… and 8 other GPU types that let you truly right-size workloads so that you’re never paying for more than you actually need<p>Example use case of our platform: 
1) Spin up a CPU-only server for $0.027&#x2F;hour to upload all of your data
2) Convert it to a GPU server to train your ML workload for $0.282&#x2F;hour
3) Convert it back to a CPU-only server to analyze the results for $0.027&#x2F;hour
4) Stop the server but keep the data for only $0.073&#x2F;GB&#x2F;month in storage costs
5) Start the server back up again, and train your next workload!<p>Celebrate our launch with us with $1 in free credit! 
Yes, we sound cheap… but $1 is all you need to get started with us! That’s more than 3 hours of compute time on our cheapest configuration! Use code HACKERNEWS_1 on the billing page to redeem this free credit.<p>TensorDock: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tensordock.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tensordock.com&#x2F;</a>
