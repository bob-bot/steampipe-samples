What&#x27;s your wants?<p>I&#x27;ll tell you what I want.<p>I want complicated open source software that everyone depends on to be better documented. I spend random hours here and there digging into open source projects such as the Linux kernel, Nginx, Postgresql and haproxy but I cannot say I understand them fully. I need to do some documenting or articles on how they work.<p>I want LuaJIT to be documented enough so that someone could implement their own JIT tracing compiler by reading the documentation.<p>I strongly recommend the Rpython documentation. It&#x27;s very good but I think it could be even more detailed.<p>I want a true scale to zero cloud infrastructure that is similar to Serverless but also scales to black Friday or Google levels of traffic. And has scalable data layer similar to Instagram or Twitter&#x27;s gizzard. I want scaling plan function that turns money into scalbility.<p>I am curious what the HN community desires are.
