Same for tweets I&#x27;ve liked or favorited: it&#x27;s an exquisitely weird experience to know I&#x27;ve seen a tweet and even favorited it, but that I&#x27;ll probably never be able to find it again.<p>A good way to find the tweets I was looking for would tick these boxes:
- <i>fast</i> (10s of ms not 100s) local search: find any tweet instantly
- easily query and export the data
- automatically sync new bookmarks or likes<p>BirdBear is my attempt to scratch this itch. It uses SQLIte in the browser via WASM to store your liked and bookmarked tweets locally, and then lets you do instant full text search over all of them (powered by SQLite&#x27;s FTS extension). There&#x27;s also a SQL console built in, so if you know SQL you can slice and dice your bookmarks and likes to your heart&#x27;s content. You can also export all your liked or bookmarked tweets as JSON to use them outside of BirdBear.<p>Right now the focus is on bookmarks and likes, but the plan is to build this into a more general twitter data tool to let you locally download tweets from all the accounts you follow, keep them up to date, and to add organization features like folders and tagging. A sort of personal tweeterbase if you will.<p>How do you keep track of the tweets you like? Any great tools or tricks you&#x27;ve discovered or features you&#x27;d like to see in a tool like this?",story,https://birdbear.app,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;m not super passionate about it so I would see a career in the field more as a means to an end. After a few years, I would like to work in a more people-oriented position.<p>1. Are those goals (working 4 day weeks and working in a &quot;managerial&quot; position) mutually exclusive? Wouldn&#x27;t a company expect it&#x27;s &quot;higher ups&quot; to commit full time to their work? I.e. is there a glass ceiling in terms of salary&#x2F;title for people who don&#x27;t work at least full time?<p>2. I like going to the office regularly but I also LOVE the idea of working remotely for a long period, say 1-2 months every summer (currently doing it and it&#x27;s amazing.) I&#x27;m sure it would be possible for a dev role, but does the same apply to a position like engineering manager?<p>3. I would also be interested in taking extended sabbaticals now and then (like unpaid time off.) I would imagine that would not be possible once you have a lot of responsibility at a company, except inbetween jobs?<p>I understand that a lot of these are absolute first-world problems. I&#x27;m just trying to weigh the pros and cons between tech and academia as accurately as possible. Thank you for any input!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
