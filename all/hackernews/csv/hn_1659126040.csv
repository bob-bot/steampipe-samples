I didn’t join because of the startup’s mission or values. I joined because I wanted to make fast money, and that was a mistake. I quit a year and a half ago. But I returned from the chaos and failure with new clarity. I realized that you have to focus on your passion, rather than just making money. I asked ‘life’ what I should do and I wrote a list of my passions. Web design was at the top. That’s when I came up with the idea for my next business. I started working on it and I didn’t panic about money because I really felt like I was in the flow of life. I asked life again to support me with money while I worked on my project — and money came. I didn’t have to boil an ocean or shake the ground to get it. People just appeared that wanted to support me. When I was ready, I immediately sold about 50 subscriptions to my platform, which allowed me eight months to work on it. It was so easy. This has been the brightest part of my life. I’ve learned that if you’re checking off your to-do list and your heart isn’t there, something needs to change. I try to stay in the flow of life as much as possible now, moment-to-moment. And doors just keep opening for me.” (from an interview in 2019)
