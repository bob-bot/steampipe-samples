In 2010, my interactive software to give the public a chance to analyze Environment Canada&#x27;s climate data was given honourable mention in BC&#x27;s Apps 4 Climate Action contest. Around that time, I installed a solar hot water heater in my home. Three years ago, I developed a calculator to show the return-on-investment for an electric vehicle. I bought an EV in 2020 for many reasons: environmental, financial (8-year ROI), and to replace a 23-year-old dilapidated gas guzzler. In 2018, I collaborated with nearly two dozen scientific illustrators to write a free e-book that explains how we know what we know about climate change, tracing from the beginning of the universe to today.<p>Some radios made by the company I work for are used by researchers in Antarctica to increase the range they can safely travel, ergo study a larger environmental surface, while remaining in contact with their base station. I&#x27;m not directly involved, though I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very cool work.<p>I am a capable, motivated, hard-working, high-tech worker. I&#x27;m not entrepreneurial. For over twelve years I&#x27;ve asked countless recruiters to find---and have myself searched for---opportunities to help develop systems that are directly related to ameliorating climate change. Anything. Battery tech, solar installations, nuclear fusion, wind power, electric transportation, carbon offsets, climate fintech, you name it. Nothing.<p>If work for software developers who want to help fight climate change is out there, it&#x27;s hiding exceedingly well.<p>From my perspective, we need to put a great deal more effort into connecting people with climate change opportunities. Imagine the Horn of Plenty overflowing with opportunities to help tackle the greatest threat of our time.<p>How do we get more hands on deck?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
