32283773,Do you regret deleting FB or IG or any social media?,2022-07-30T02:28:03Z,happyexplorer,3,false,false,2,"[32283911,32283812]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"I have long been thinking about deleting my FB account after taking out all the info and datapoints. I have been actively using FB many years ago, I still have a lot of &quot;friends on facebook&quot; who I haven&#x27;t really talked with in over 3-4 years, I still go to FB because it&#x27;s a habit and all I get is the waste of time in groups about birds not being real. I feel the urge to delete FB to become more productive (I know, sounds funny). I have already deleted most social media apps from my phone, but I still use it all via browser. There are no benefits from FB, I don&#x27;t know why I need it, I have not used FB to communicate with anyone from real life in over 4 years. I know many of you have been deleting facebook accounts over a really long time due to data sharing concerns – but after deleting, do you find yourself missing anything from FB? Do you wish you could bring back time and not delete FB? Or do you simply not think about it anymore? I know it should not be a big deal, but FB was the center of my online life many years ago and although, now looking back, I realise it was rather unhealthy and obsessive, I still feel like deleting it would delete a significant part of my life, even if it was in the past.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
