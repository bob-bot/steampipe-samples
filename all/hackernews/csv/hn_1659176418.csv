Between these scripts, there are many common routines. Eg. making ssh connections, execution and collecting data. Based on the subprocess and Paramiko, I created the SSHScript. With it, I could embed shell commands in Python scripts. This kind of script  is  converted to a regular Python script by SSHScript  for execution . Working with SSHScript, I feel like writing shell scripts with Python and all Python packages.

32285593,Show HN: The Poetry Corner – A React Native app to read public domain poems,2022-07-30T10:11:22Z,archiepeach,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"TLDR - scratched my own itch with an app, added a pro plan and got my first subscribers this week!<p>Last December I started digging into poetry, it was a topic I always thought I liked, but just hadn’t explored very much. I soon discovered that a lot of the poetry sites online had pretty annoying designs, e.g. ads right at the end of the poem, (muting any emotional impact).<p>I also have wanted to be able to easily save a list of my favourites to easily come back to.<p>I decided to build and release a react native app which addressed these issues. It took about 4 weeks during the winter break to release an MVP to the App Store. The backend is using Firebase, which has been superb in allowing me to bootstrap the app quickly.<p>I soon added a poem of the day feature, which forced me into curation (needing to find 365 poems for the year!).  I’ve discovered so many amazing poems and poets as a result. One of the things I love about tech is that it can touch so many different domains and industries.<p>Anyway, fast forward six months of continuous development, adding features and refining the design, lots of late nights. I finally had enough of a feature set to demarcate some out to a paid plan with a free trial. And the first users have actually started subscribing!<p>I’ll soon be ramping up ads, currently just on the App Store Search, but soon with Google and Instagram. I’ll be seeing if I can spend x amount on ads to net a return in subscriptions. If so, I’ll be scaling it as fast as the budget will allow.<p>For the instagram ads, I’ll be marketing the poetry app with a mindfulness twist. Some people have already talked about this connection online, and I’ve personally experienced a deeper bond with nature and awareness of my own feelings as a result of reading so many poems.<p>So that’s where the app is now, and where I have in mind to take it. It’s been super fun working on it and any feedback is welcome!",story,https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/the-poetry-corner/id1602552624,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

To keep it short, moderators on Reddit use an official bot called u&#x2F;AutoModerator that is primarily used to automatically perform a set of actions when certain keywords are used.<p>The problem with this bot is that it&#x27;s not user-friendly at all, so even to make it do the most basic action you need to read the documentation. Since most people are to lazy to read it, there&#x27;s an official subreddit called r&#x2F;AutoModerator to let people ask and answer questions about it, and I&#x27;ve been fairly active there.<p>6 days ago, I came across a post from a user that didn&#x27;t understand why their AutoMod code wasn&#x27;t working. I asked them to send me the code, and when they did I fixed it by simply adding two square brackets around the keywords. The code they were trying to make would remove comments that contained some common racist words. After I send them the working code, they thanked me for being helpful and added it to their own AutoMod configuration.<p>6 days after that, I receive a primave message from the official Reddit account saying:<p>&gt; You’ve been banned from Reddit for three days for violating Reddit’s rule against promoting hate in the following content.
&gt; Link to reported content: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;AutoModerator&#x2F;comments&#x2F;w5l6sd&#x2F;comment&#x2F;ihhhqi2&#x2F;
&gt; Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. We don’t tolerate promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability, and any communities or people that encourage or incite violence or hate towards marginalized or vulnerable groups will be banned.<p>Reddit literally site-wide banned me, an active moderator of 7+ communities, for helping a fellow moderator remove racist comments in their own community. The reason? &quot;Promoting hate based on identity or vulnerability&quot;. No good deed goes unpunished, I guess<p>I have already submitted a ban appeal and I&#x27;m currently waiting for a response. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments, since I can&#x27;t use Reddit I have a lot of time to answer them...",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
