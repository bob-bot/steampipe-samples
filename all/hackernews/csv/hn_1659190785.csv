The code does not appear in the app, in any mail folder including spam, nor in their message center in the app or website.<p>So why does a company that supposedly uses AWS for its own services, is unable to deliver the code or update the code in whatever database backs up the delivery subsystem? Are they perhaps using eventual consistency measured in days (like Glacier might)? Is the pizza sized team responsible out of pizzas? Or perhaps the cost of a button to resend (or send the first time) the locker code too expensive? Or maybe the delivery person&#x27;s app lacks reliable communications, or the act of delivery is too manual to work reliably? I would really like to know why this is so terrible. I spent nearly 40 years building reliable systems of many kinds, so this make me genuinely curious as to why such a big company fails in such a simple action.<p>Also I wish Amazon had actual humans providing help instead of chatbots without a clue.

I&#x27;m tempted to just ask them to review it because I don&#x27;t know what could even be flagged but I&#x27;m afraid that they will give me trouble for it later if they find the same &#x27;deception&#x27; again.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
