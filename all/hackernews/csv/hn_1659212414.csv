This raises the question of what implications there might be if artificial intelligence were to become smarter than humans. Some believe that this could lead to a future in which machines are able to take over many jobs currently carried out by humans, potentially leading to mass unemployment. Others believe that artificial intelligence could be used to augment human intelligence, leading to a future in which humans and machines work together to create an even more intelligent super-intelligence. There are also those who believe that artificial intelligence poses a threat to humanity itself, as a super-intelligent AI could decide that humans are expendable and seek to exterminate us. Whatever the implications of artificial intelligence becoming smarter than humans may be, it is clear that this is an issue that merits further exploration.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32289842,Ask HN: Locked out of Amazon accounts for a month,2022-07-30T20:09:37Z,nikolay,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Suddenly Amazon Shopping asked me to change my password. I got authenticated, including with my 2FA, and picked a new password, but I keep getting server errors that something went wrong and asking me to retry later. I attempted on different browsers, the mobile app, incognito mode, etc. I kept trying this for weeks, hoping somebody would attend to the logging errors. Finally, I opened a ticket with Amazon Shopping, which has not been worked on for a month after being on the phone with them twice. Yesterday, I tried to use my AWS account and have a support plan for it but encountered the same issue. My IAM users and root user also experiences the same problems, and a password reset is mandated without explaining why. For whatever reason, Amazon has flagged all my accounts and IAM users as needing a password reset, and their password reset system does not work, and I&#x27;m locked out of everywhere! Their support pretends that they care, but nothing has changed! At least I managed to ask them to refund my Prime subscription, which I cannot use - I can&#x27;t tell if it got canceled as I got no emails confirming that. I need a purchase receipt - I don&#x27;t have access to them for the same reason. This is turning into a huge nightmare. I cannot do anything with my useless support subscriptions as, obviously, to get a good case into the system, you need to be able to log in. I pinged their Twitter support, and they again pretended they cared, but nothing different happened. I can&#x27;t even cancel the useless support subscription.<p>I am pretty sure this is some software change issue, given how old my Amazon Shopping and AWS accounts are. They&#x27;ve flagged my account for some reason, although I have received no notification about this.<p>Given how much of my online shopping life relied on Amazon Shopping and AWS, which, even with paid support nowadays, seems useless, this is not acceptable for a modern technology company! I tried purchasing certain products directly, but many manufacturers work exclusively with Amazon.<p>At the end of the day, Amazon is losing revenue, not me. And sends a clear message that something&#x27;s wrong with their system, which used to provide quality support and considered the logging process sacred - we all know the original Amazon Shopping, which even allowed people to create multiple accounts with the same email so that they can still complete their purchases. This is no longer the chase! A forced password reset goes against what made them big!<p>I am looking into alternatives such as Walmart+ and Amazon will lose loyal customers spending thousands every month. For supplements, for example, I&#x27;m trying to move my business to iHerb - I&#x27;ve already canceled all my Subscribe &amp; Save subscriptions thru their customer service (that they can handle, but they can&#x27;t remove the requirement to reset the password).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
