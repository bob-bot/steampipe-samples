Over 3.5 years of extraordinary litigation in Travis County, Austin TX, I prevailed completely in a historic 9-day jury trial for child custody in May this year. The jury deliberated for nearly 3.5 days and 11 of the 12 members agreed on 10 of the 10 questions in the jury charge sheet and gave a verdict that favored me in every question.<p>However, the judge has ruled against me in the rulings completely disregarding the jury verdict, and now I will see my two children only once every other weekend. This is devastating for my children and me. Is there any family law legal expert on HN that could help?<p>Please help! Thank you!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;m faking my way through the day, pretending to care when I don&#x27;t. I used to love technology, but my passion is gone.<p>I&#x27;m a woman and LGBT, fwiw, and it can be a lonely and tiring experience when men seem to be coasting along much easier in most settings. All my coworkers are straight and married with families and I feel like the lone weirdo. We were also recently acquired by a company whose leadership is entirely older white straight men, not that it was much better or different pre-acquisition.<p>What I deeply miss is the feeling that I&#x27;m actually <i>making</i> something. Creating something of value. Not shepherding around the people who are creating things. I have good people skills, which has landed me more in management and leadership positions, but really what I crave is long periods of working without meetings to worry about.<p>I&#x27;ve developed deep anxiety around time management and meetings. I feel I can never relax for fear of missing the next meeting.<p>I am seeing an excellent therapist who is helping me cope. But I don&#x27;t want to just cope. I&#x27;ve lost my love for technology, my drive to do more than the bare minimum (which is anathema to my personality up until about 7 months ago).<p>My interest in code and now expertise in product management leads me to think I could make a great software engineer, provided I put in a lot more training. With my &quot;product sense&quot; I think I&#x27;d be pretty desirable to employers.<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
