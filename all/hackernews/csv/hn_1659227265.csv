Through some different pacing of job interviews (and the hiring freezes), I am in a situation and I am not sure whats the best path forward.<p>I have an offer that I really like.  Great pay increase, hiring manager seems great, in a city I really want to move to.  The only downside is its a generic Java Backend role (which is what my first job it).  Its not bad, because I do enjoy backend work, but I have been really interested in moving into low level programming.  I&#x27;ve wanted to try getting a job working in C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Rust and on OS stuff or low level cloud stuff.<p>I currently have a chill job and I could turn this offer down and keep applying to jobs in hopes of getting everything I want + also the low level aspect, but I don&#x27;t know if I am gonna regret turning down an offer that basically has everything just because I want to keep searching.<p>It is not like I am unemployed so I have no real reason to jump ship, but I am not payed well now and live in the middle of no where.  I can tolerate it in the short term, but I don&#x27;t want to spend another 6+ months here.  I want a new job relatively soon.<p>EDIT: I guess my question is, is it a good idea to try and wait?  I am a bit inexperienced (1.5 YOE) and I work at a bank not an actual tech company, while the offer is a tech company.  So should I go there first as a stepping stone? Then go for the ideal job once I have more experience?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
