I escaped to Russia and now I&#x27;m looking for a place to live and rebuild my life. A good friend agreed to sponsor me and my parents via a Uniting for Ukraine program, so that we can come and stay in US for 2 years that the program covers.<p>Considering that USA has huge tech market, it seems like a great proposition career wise, plus I know English already. But I worry about perspectives of such move. Will companies want to hire me knowing that my status is temporary and quite short at that (2 years)? Even if company likes me and is ready to propose a work visa it looks like there is a high chance that I don&#x27;t get the visa. Then what, the end? I go home at the end of 2 years? Is there a path towards longer-term US residence?<p>Plus, I worry about EAD work authorization with wait times around 6-9 months, which will make it difficult to sustain ourselves during that time. Some of my friends say that going to US is not worth it in my circumstances, and some say that it&#x27;s easier to figure things out being there and that &#x27;you&#x27;ll find the way&#x27;. I&#x27;m pretty sad and overwhelmed due to the war and my circumstances, I&#x27;m looking everywhere, so I wanted to ask HN opinion about perspectives of going to US to try and build new life there.<p>Michael",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
