A year ago, when I finished the first draft, I perhaps would have seen this outcome as some sort of letdown but I find myself quite excited right now... making the book itself is just a continuation of the creative process, and I really want to do it the right way.<p>I have some savings that I had set aside for this sort of project and have decided it would be best to get professional help for each step, rather than just DIYing (I had DIYd a &quot;test&quot; project a couple years ago, so am familiar with KDP, etc.)  So am looking for recommendations for: 
a) editors (both dev&#x2F;line and copy&#x2F;proof) 
b) designers  
c) publicists 
that the HN community may have had good experience with.<p>Many professionals choose not to work with self-published authors, so finding them not always straightforward. On the other side, there are MANY shady organizations that will gladly separate a self-published author from his&#x2F;her money. So figured reaching out to this group (esp for an SF novel) may get me some luck and direct references.<p>Thanks to all in advance!<p>[0] Comment thread on HN I found quite useful on the road to traditional publishing: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31443890",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
