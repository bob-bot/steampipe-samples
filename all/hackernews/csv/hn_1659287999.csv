The &quot;Apply&quot; link redirects to the original job posting such as from angel.co.<p>The only reason I was able to tell these are not legitimate is because the descriptions of the posts clearly describe a different company.<p>So it seems to be a phishing opportunity is to create a profile on LinkedIn or angel.co with a company name that matches your target company. Write some job postings with descriptions that look like a job posting that the company would actually hire. And now those job postings will be reposted onto the official LinkedIn pages of the company, and applicants will be redirected to your phished webpage.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

They provide lots of value but quickly become uncontrollably full of noise. Plus, it&#x27;s so easy to use these tools that people don&#x27;t stop even for a second to think about what they ask (impact, context, etc.) and the consequences of interrupting people, forcing them to switch contexts continuously. This is detrimental to deep work.<p>Sick of this, I decided to talk with some 40 people at companies small to big (Uber, Spotify, Stripe, etc.) and dig deeper to understand if and how they solve this problem.<p>It turns out that in many companies with more than 300-400 people, the amount of tools and noise created becomes uncontrollable. Plus, it&#x27;s strenuous to enforce communication policies in the workplace.<p>I then decided to build a tool that you can think of as Calendly for task management. Instead of allowing people to bombard you from everywhere in an uncontrollable and unstructured way (WhatsApp, Slack, Emails, etc.), you give them a link, and they fill requests with the information you previously defined as required&#x2F;optional.<p>Plus, you can plug in Trello and Asana (more to come) so that you don’t have to copy and paste requests that come your way into your personal or team board.<p>Plus, requesters automatically update on changes without accessing your board or having an account.<p>Please let me know if this is total bs or provides any value to you.<p>Note: I developed this in 1 month so expect things to break potentially.<p>I sincerely thank any feedback either here below, at romeo@getisla.com, or in the site&#x27;s chat.",story,https://getisla.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
