I found this to be a big improvement. Some images are much clearer and it gives the book a more premium feel.<p>Why are the print versions never in color? I usually pay between 40-60euros for these books which I don’t consider cheap. I assume the majority of the price of these books goes to covering fixed costs and that the cost to print one book is only a few euros.
