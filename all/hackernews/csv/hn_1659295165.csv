I think I am fairly good in this with some project in machine learning as well. Covid-19 messed up my college and did&#x27;nt pay attention to my computer science engineering bachelors subjects. With me being a new comer to this tech world, I realize I need to do my part with core concepts like, Hardware, networking, PC making, OS , microprocessors .. along with incorporating my learning in ML and other new technologies. My wish to learn the core concepts has nothing to do with any requirement with my current profession in programming. But I do feel like I lack core concepts and have this peer pressure to know these things, to be able to call myself a &#x27;techie&#x27; . Has anyone ever felt this need to learn all these basics ? The quantity of this thing is so huge that I know cannot be achieved in a single month or two. And I know this also requires physical applications in some areas to fully understand it. I am unable to comprehend how to incorporate all the old school computer basics into my daily learnings along with being able to have time to keep up current programming technologies. So yeah:<p>1. I would love to hear experiences of people starting new into the computer world with not just basic - turn on and shut down kinda start, but actual core concepts, how did you start and what things did you start with, how long did it take and what was your motivation ?<p>2. What things should I start with ? Courses, links, materials on Operating system, Computer Hardware, Networking, Microprocessors&#x2F;controllers, PC making and any other topic that you feel like I should add to it.<p>3. It started purely from my genuine interest in these topics, but over the time I feel like I am under peer pressure to know these things.. Is this the right away I am addressing this phase&#x2F;thought ?<p>4. Anyone has a good idea of how do I Implement learning this large amount of knowledge learning along with new constant learning in profession based technology learning.. Will it burn me out ? Any thing on this will help.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
