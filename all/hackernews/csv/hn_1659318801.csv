32300861,Ask HN: How do you manage VMs on your workstations?,2022-08-01T01:37:21Z,3np,1,false,false,<null>,[32300901],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Preamble:<p>I am yet to find a structured, comfortable and sustainable way to manage local VMs. I&#x27;m  usually falling back to just Virtualbox with the disk file being a reoccurring annoyance and liability. I must have 100s GB of files scattered around in old backups where I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s inside. Reproducibility and  efficient use of resources is an issue. I&#x27;d also like to be quickly set up and tear down VMs a - much like Qubes OS.<p>I imagine many of you have similar scenarios, which is prompting this post.<p>Some use-cases could include:<p>* Build environment for large projects with relatively complex pipelines where I have multiple on current configurations and checkouts
  * Examples: Various Linux dists, AOSP forks, embedded projects
* Persisted isolated &quot;persona&quot; environments for e.g. web browsing and development, routing all its traffic through some particular gateway or proxy
* Work environments for recording screencasts&#x2F;demos
* Pentesting
* (Semi-) permanent services with exposed ports
* Working on a VM remotely from a laptop (where the laptop is on Wayland)<p>I already host a lot of stuff on actual servers (tools include: Linux,Ansible,Terraform,Kubernetes&#x2F;Nomad,Consul). While I&#x27;d love to use Terraform here, I&#x27;m not really intending to bring the machine into a cluster or anything like that.<p>Some requirements and wishes:<p>* It should be possible to somehow manage the entire configuration in a git repo
* Declarative configuration
* I can interact with GUI applications (e.g. disposable browser window)
* Selectively share Wayland clipboard
* Reasonably straightforward routing config (e.g. &quot;route all connections on this VM through whonix&quot;)
* Some form of remote desktop
* VM has its own kernel
* Portable: If I bring the configuration and artefacts it should be straightforward to migrate to a new host OS.
* Composability &#x2F; inheritance for environments.<p>A lot of this is close to QubesOS, except:<p>* I want Wayland. Qubes will take its time to get there.
* More in general, I suspect qubes dom0 is not really configurable to behave like I want without significant patches to the point of becoming a new distro.
* Still find maintaining Qubes and keeping updated has not been an ideal experience.
* Not portable - at this point I&#x27;m not looking for a new host OS.
* Not sure how to set up the remoting<p>As for Vagrant, it checks a lot of the boxes (heh). I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience with it but been using it in projects every now and then and wrote my own Vagrantfiles maybe a handful times. It does seem perfect for dev or build workspaces - in practice I usually use Dockerfiles here.<p>libvirt has a variety of management interfaces and built-in remote support.<p>Did do some basic testing with existing Terraform providers for libvirt, virtualbox, and vagrant - the libvirt one seems mature enough.<p>So for now my candidate pieces here:<p>* libvirtd
* qemu&#x2F;kvm
* virtualbox
* vagrant
* terraform
* kvm
* whonix
* packer<p>Now, while I have at least some rudimentary experience with a lot pof these, I am a bit at a loss for the best way to tie them together and which I even want in the mix. For example, one possible configuration would be:<p>Terraform -&gt; terraform-provider-vagrant -&gt; vagrant -&gt; vagrant-libvirt -&gt; libvirt -&gt; qemu -&gt; kvm (image built with packer-qemu)<p>This seems kind of silly but gets to my point: How do you do it?<p>On Arch Linux BTW.`",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
