Looking for some advice as I transition away from a largely academic environment to industry.<p>I work in robotics. I am currently enrolled in a top ~3 robotics program in the US, working on robot learning. Previously I worked on different robotics problems including: heuristic based path-planning, multi-robot systems, UAVs, SLAM etc. Through my research, I&#x27;ve gained experience in Python and to a lesser extent in C++ as well. Prior to joining the grad program I worked as a Research Intern in a US semiconductor company&#x27;s research division, on developing algorithms for SLAM (I developed kalman filters, keypoint extraction and map storage&#x2F;retrieval). Most of these projects were &quot;systems projects&quot;, implying that the primary innovation was combining exisiting algorithms&#x2F;methods into a complete end-to-end-system, rather than novel research contributions, but hey I&#x27;m not complaining! I really enjoy systems work turns out, which brings me to my point...<p>This brief stint showed me the stark contrast between academia and industry. It has me wondering if I&#x27;m much better for industry, since I feel my short and long-term incentives are much more aligned in industry rather than academia.<p>So I want to ask HN: How do I prepare for similar robotics&#x2F;deep learning&#x2F;computer-vision&#x2F;machine learning jobs in industry? There seem to be a ton of advice for people venturing into SWE&#x2F;SDE roles but not that much for &quot;Research Engineer&quot; positions.<p>Do I hit LeetCode? Do I improve my webpage? Do I start a blog? If I need to grind at LeetCode, what kind of challenges should I be focusing on? The keywords that I&#x27;d use to describe my skillset would include: Python&#x2F;C++&#x2F;TensorFlow2&#x2F;Pytorch&#x2F;OpenCV&#x2F;ROS<p>Any and all advice is highly appreciated!<p>PS: If you think I would fit well with your organization, please let me know! I often feel like organizations wouldn&#x27;t want &quot;generalists&quot; and instead prefer &quot;specialists&quot;.<p>-transitionAcad",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
