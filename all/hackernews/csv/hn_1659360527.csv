But I have recovered.<p>How?<p>Because it needs to be done.<p>As developers, we are there to solve problems. We are not there to be good at C or JAVA or Python or some such tool. We have to address the issues. If you could use pixie dust and your pixie dust could solve all problems, your clients and I could care less about your fondness for Python or your identity as a ‘Linux guy’. We are here to solve problems.<p>In a broader sense, the business is there not only to solve a problem (represented by an excellent working product) but also to tell people that it exists and can solve the said problem.<p>So business has 2 problems. And it needs to solve these two problems at the meta-level.<p>1) Solve the problem customers have.<p>2) Reach them and let them know you have something that solves their problem.<p>The 2nd one is called marketing.<p>But who cares?<p>It is just problem-solving.<p>Does it matter that you don’t like it?<p>Because it solves a problem.<p>Ok. So we agree on that point at least. Let us look at this further.<p>“Marketers” will tell you there are many different types of marketing.<p>Digital marketing, SEO inbound, outbound, PR.<p>I can see that you are about to have seizures. YOU can NEVER do all that. Don&#x27;t worry.<p>Instead of all this jargon, let’s return to the original problem of reaching and telling people you have something that solves their problems.<p>Let me now, gently propose the idea of Writing. Because, in my mind, Marketing is nothing but Writing.<p>The internet is a prominent place. It has only two functions when you reduce it to the basics.<p>“Someone writes something into it” Or “Someone reads something from it.”<p>Like, right now. I am writing this, and you are reading this. That’s it. This action, repeated a million times, is the internet. Everything else is arbitrage.<p>We don’t want anything to do with these other shady forms of marketing.<p>But we surely can’t have any problem giving something to the place that offers something to us?<p>Like, I am writing this (giving), and I will get some readers and maybe some clients (getting), right?<p>Fair transaction. Nothing shady. It is the most innocent form of the web. It is the most natural, honest, unbiased, and evergreen form of marketing.<p>So here is what I urge you to consider now.<p>Solve the 2nd problem I listed by simply writing into the web.<p>Just write. And it will give back to you.<p>I know you won’t like it.<p>But those are only in the beginning and remember, so what? So what if you don’t like it. It solves the problem.<p>Consider it. Let this not happen today.<p>Let this idea seep into your mind slowly over time.<p>Start slow and ramp up, accumulate writing over time. Like I did. After years of resisting, fighting, throwing tantrums, I think today I get it.<p>It has allowed me to build something that has given me financial freedom. Writing has.<p>All I did was solve both those problems I listed earlier. I have built my SAAS product Proxies API as well as the habit of writing.<p>Coding plus Writing makes me dangerous.<p>The author is the founder of Proxies API the rotating proxies service.<p>This article originally appeared here:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.proxiesapi.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;Developers-If-You-Can-Master-Writing-You-Will-Be-Dangerous.php",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
