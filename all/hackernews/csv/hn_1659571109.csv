32337637,Ask HN: How do you make the most of a bad interview,2022-08-03T23:28:05Z,cbreezyyall,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Context: I do technical interviews for various roles at my company. The interview lasts 45 minutes and I primarily test people on their data modeling and SQL skills, though sometimes I ask some easy scripting questions if it&#x27;s more relevant. The questions aren&#x27;t particularly challenging, unless you don&#x27;t know SQL&#x2F;programming.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing these interviews for 3-4 years now, and have seen a wide spectrum of candidates from people who finish everything in 15 minutes, to people who maybe don&#x27;t know all the syntax but can talk me through their reasoning and get to a solution with coaching, to people who explicitly say they don&#x27;t know how to write code and spend the entire 45 minutes in an awkward struggle session.<p>It&#x27;s that bottom half that I&#x27;m looking for advice on how to make the most of the interview time. I don&#x27;t want the candidates to feel like it&#x27;s been a complete waste of time, and if I can get them to show me that they can share their thought process and learn something, it can push them from a hard no to a soft no or even a soft yes (depending on the position). I&#x27;m not a huge fan of these types of white board interviews so I will always give them answers on correct syntax if they can tell me what they want a line to do (and generally act like a knowledge base because there&#x27;s never an instance in real life where you wouldn&#x27;t have any of this info available to you). What are some techniques you&#x27;ve found effective when candidates are struggling? When do you stop giving hints and start to give portions of the answer?<p>Some things I&#x27;ve been doing are
In general:
- If it&#x27;s been silent for more than a minute, and the candidate hasn&#x27;t said or typed anything, asking what they&#x27;re thinking about
- Asking them to explain what they want to accomplish in a normal sentence, and then hopefully pseudocode
- Regularly making sure they&#x27;ve understood the question.<p>Data modeling and SQL:
- Making up example data based off the schema they&#x27;ve come up with and posing situations where their model would have issues
- Giving example result sets based on the query they&#x27;ve written vs what I&#x27;ve asked for
- Giving example data and asking for a query that would return something similar.<p>Scripting:
- Giving counterexamples that don&#x27;t work with their solution
- Walking through their solution with said examples and pointing out the step it fails on
- When time starts to run out, giving them a piece of the solution that&#x27;s been tripping them up the most and seeing if they can move on from there.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
