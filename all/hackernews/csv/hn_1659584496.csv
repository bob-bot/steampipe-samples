32338779,Ask HN: What's up with these DoorDash dark patterns?,2022-08-04T02:48:48Z,flycatcha,7,false,false,3,"[32338873,32338899]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;m in the Bay Area. We don&#x27;t order using apps often, but when we do we find that so much of the selection consists of mediocre looking Chinese, Indian, pizza and Mexican.<p>Using the current Android mobile app, you can&#x27;t actually drill into and read reviews which makes assessing the actual quality of the restaurant difficult.<p>And I&#x27;ve found that restaurants will run their own &quot;ghost kitchen&quot; shadow restaurant out of their main (poorly rated) location. This delivery specific restaurant has good reviews on DD, but when you Google that restaurant name nothing comes up aside from listings on the app. And then the food arrives and it&#x27;s terrible and you match up the physical address and realize it&#x27;s a poorly rated Indian restaurant by a different name.<p>Or, you order from one of these weird ghost kitchen brands and the actual restaurant doesn&#x27;t actually get your order (despite the app telling you they confirmed it) and your second driver finally tells you to cancel the order.<p>Is it asking too much to have a service that&#x27;s transparent, functions well and have the end product taste good?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Laravel charges upfront and have a large userbase so I think it&#x27;s doing well.<p>Vercel, Supabase seem to have very genorous free tiers. So, I was wondering if these models are profitable? Do they even want to be profitable or are they planning to make money be selling the business to a bigger company?<p>There&#x27;s also Sidekiq, a job processing server for ruby, the free version of it is GPL licensed so it can be used only on other open source projects, the author is selling pro and enterprise versions that have a closed source license and extra features on a monthly subscription basis. He makes $4 million + per year by himself. I think that&#x27;s pretty crazy, ideally I&#x27;d like to do a solo business too and avoid having to manage a team. But I think this is a very unicorn case. I don&#x27;t think a GPL licensed tool has a good chance in the TypeScript space.<p>So what do you think I should I do?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
