Laravel charges upfront and have a large userbase so I think it&#x27;s doing well.<p>Vercel, Supabase seem to have very genorous free tiers. So, I was wondering if these models are profitable? Do they even want to be profitable or are they planning to make money be selling the business to a bigger company?<p>There&#x27;s also Sidekiq, a job processing server for ruby, the free version of it is GPL licensed so it can be used only on other open source projects, the author is selling pro and enterprise versions that have a closed source license and extra features on a monthly subscription basis. He makes $4 million + per year by himself. I think that&#x27;s pretty crazy, ideally I&#x27;d like to do a solo business too and avoid having to manage a team. But I think this is a very unicorn case. I don&#x27;t think a GPL licensed tool has a good chance in the TypeScript space.<p>So what do you think I should I do?<p>Edit: I&#x27;m realizing this is a news site and not a forum.
