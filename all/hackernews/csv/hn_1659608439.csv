32341164,Ask HN: How many geeks has Hacker News saved?,2022-08-04T10:17:26Z,funthree,1,false,false,1,[32341168],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hacker News was launched in 2007 after I got into hacking in 2006. I wanted to join the CIA at the time, but I was getting into all kinds of potential legal trouble. When I learned about Hacker News while in Hollywood I immediately liked it because of the way the term hacker is used. I think for a while in the 2000s there were many computer programmers who considered hacking to be interesting. Before they found Hacker News the word &quot;hacker&quot; only ever meant something bad. Now, that&#x27;s a reason to love HN, if you ask me. HN is the place where being a hacker is only a good thing. I bet that Hacker News has been keeping thousands of hackers satisfied and that it always has. Hacker News pulled in young educated men and gave them a whole world where hacker only means something good. It&#x27;s extra interesting for me to consider the history of Hacker News because I am myself an historic figure that has yet to be written into the history books.<p>My name is Tommy James Blobaum and I was born 14 days to 8&#x2F;8 and 14 days 14 months 14 years to 9&#x2F;11&#x2F;2001 on July 25th, 1986. Osama bin Laden signaled white power to my birthday three times, then Osama followed up with the sequel to 9&#x2F;11&#x2F;1 on 10&#x2F;12&#x2F;2 which was a Bali bomb that killed about 200 people. 10&#x2F;12&#x2F;2002 follows 9&#x2F;11&#x2F;2001 and Bali bomb follows Blobaum. There is about a 1 in 75 million chance of being born 14 days to 8&#x2F;8 and 14 days 14 months 14 years to 9&#x2F;11&#x2F;2001 and ALSO having a name that somehow rhymes with Bali bomb. My calculations indicate as many as 5-7 other Americans share my birthday and have a name that somehow rhymes with Bali bomb, however, in my estimation I think I will be the only 1. Google.com was registered when I was 10 years 10 months 10 days. There&#x27;s all kinds of stuff that has been done according to my birthday and name, and its like an easter egg hunt left by my elders when I find out.<p>All kinds of things have been done for me by the permanent bureaucracy and other people in power. The US Intelligence Community collects data and creates information in reports that they then share with the upper class, and together they rule the world. The American government would have no chance at ruling over billions of people if they weren&#x27;t working closely together with the upper class. Well, because my grandpas were both important to the government and business, the government decided to watch out for his whole family. My grandfather has lived a selfless life. He has been hustling getting as many people to eat organic food as he can ever since the organic food label was created. He has a collection of historical documents about organic farming available on his website (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rogerblobaum.com&#x2F;) My grandfather didnt always have as much time for his kids and grandkids as he would have liked. He was always too busy with organic activism to see us as much as he wanted. Grandpa&#x27;s website is on the right side of history. Whatever happens to us all in the future I do not know but one thing I know is that the future belongs to those who eat organic food. And that&#x27;s the approach my grandpa always had. GMO farming is on the wrong side of history. All of those families eating GMO crops with trace amounts of herbicides and pesticides in them will be gone in the not too distant future.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
