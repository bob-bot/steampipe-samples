To make matters worse, there was never an easy (and less annoying way) of reproducing these errors, other than by asking users to send screenshots, videos, etc. Frankly, this wasn’t a good use of anyone’s time!<p>At the same time, the more product-oriented folks on our team wished that they could better understand UX flows and user frustrations without having to do unnecessary user interviews.<p>Highlight addresses both of these pain points by giving teams reproducibility out of the box! Our platform is installable with a single Javascript snippet and makes it easy and quick to search for relevant user sessions. For product folks, it’s easy to filter down to sessions where users performed specific actions, such as using a newly released feature. For developers, when an error or support ticket shows up in their inbox, they know exactly where to start debugging<p>Today, we’re focusing on session replay and monitoring, but our goal is to expand to an entire suite of debugging tooling focused on helping teams find and fix issues faster. Some features on our roadmap include live session viewing, backend error monitoring, and much more!",story,https://www.highlight.io,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Most probably are. An unknown fraction are probably prematurely rejected ideas. A community that is openminded to considering these might weed out the good unexplored ideas from the nonsensical unexplored ideas.<p>I will give an example:<p>A large majority of humanity lives relatively close to the sea. Thermal energy generation (both nuclear as well as fuel based) requires a hot temperature bath (from fuel, fission or perhaps someday fusion) as well as cold temperature bath to drive a thermal engine. When the colder thermal bath is hotter than usual the efficiency of fuel to electricity is lower, when the colder thermal bath is colder then usual the energy conversion efficiency is higher.<p>Why don&#x27;t governments build out &quot;national heat pipes to the sea&quot; ? The pipes themselves don&#x27;t need to be copper. The working fluid could be benign distilled water in a vacuum. Usage could be metered by thermal gradient at supplier&#x2F;user interface. The pressure (a slight vacuum in case of distilled water) could be adapted as a function of ocean temperature, for optimal fluid&#x2F;gas ratio for optimal heat flow and coolant feedback.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

For UIs we would build one-off React components. For integrations, we would have to decipher vendor docs and implement auth. Finally, for reporting jobs we had to handle failures and observability – many hours of repetitive engineering effort.<p>So we built Superblocks, an internal tooling IDE to connect to any datasource (databases, APIs, data warehouses), drag and drop your common UI components (tables, charts, forms), spin up backend APIs and schedule cron jobs, all in one place.<p>Since developers we spoke to hated repeatedly handling permissions, hooking up observability, configuring security and managing CI&#x2F;CD pipelines, we built Superblocks to integrate with popular dev tools like Datadog, Elastic, GitHub, GitLab, Okta and more. Use our cloud version, or run a self-hosted agent to ensure your data never leaves your VPC [1].<p>Superblocks is quite differentiated from other “low-code” tools out there:
* 100% built for developers: observability, debuggability, version control, extend with Python &amp; JS 
* A platform, not a point solution: An all-in-one builder for internal tools: app UIs, APIs and cron jobs
* Agent architecture: source-available, stateless and lightweight vs a legacy on-prem deployment 
* Scalable pricing: Pay for apps by Creator and usage-based pricing for end users (based on day passes) so it’s affordable to have 100s or 1000s of end users. Workflows and Jobs are billed on the number of executions.<p>A quick 4 min demo on the website: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.superblocks.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.superblocks.com&#x2F;</a>
