Overall I think I can understand over 95% of what someone using Airpods says, but it takes so much more mental energy and focus, compared to the people that have a little boom mic on a legit headset or have a desktop mic.  If someone using Airpods has a non-native-English accent, then my comprehension drops even more and I find it really taxing to piece together what they are saying.  In 2022, I really started struggling with so-called Zoom-fatigue and I&#x27;ve narrowed down the biggest factor to struggling to understand what people are saying with Airpods (combined with having to crank the volume of my headphones on my end).<p>I have dug into the issue with specific people and often we discover that they were inadvertently using the mic from their laptop or webcam.  When we restored audio input to the Airpods, there was an improvement, but the audio quality still, for the most part, kind of, just ... sucks.<p>Is it just me?  If not, can this serve as a PSA to Airpod users to upgrade to a simple, legit headset or desktop mic for the benefit of your fellow employees?<p>Airpod users: 
Do you find people asking you to repeat yourself in meetings?  
Have you tested out your set up (where the video conf app records your voice and plays it back to you)?
Side question: Do you have any health concerns about making wireless earbuds your long-term choice of audio hardware, given we&#x27;re going to be using video conferences for the foreseeable future?  I&#x27;m sure Bluetooth is generally &quot;safe,&quot; but what of the health effects of long-term (3-8 hours per day for the next 5+ years) use of two wireless radio transmitters so close to your brain?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
