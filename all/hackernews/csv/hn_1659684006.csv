Maybe I am too picky but I didn&#x27;t like the available options so I built one myself.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works:<p>- You create a mailing list on the landing page (weightless.so)<p>- It gives you a URL you can attach to a &lt;form&gt; tag as an action attribute<p>- Any time someone submits that form, you receive an email with your subscribers<p>Collecting emails this way is free, and if you already have a styled form, you can have this up &amp;  running in couple minutes.<p>I know Show HN posts shouldn&#x27;t require signing up, but I do need to have an email because that&#x27;s where you get your subscribers list.<p>One note: Weightless also allows you send mass emails to your subscribers, but that&#x27;s a paid feature. You DON&#x27;T have to use it, you can use Weightless only for collecting emails, and worry about messaging them later. When you are starting out and have only a couple subscribers, you can simply email everyone manually, one by one.",story,https://weightless.so/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This feature allows you to create a link that will permit anyone to join your Slack workspace; it is an alternative to inviting people one-by-one via email to become workspace members. You are receiving this email because you created and&#x2F;or revoked one of these links for your workspace between April 17, 2017 and July 17, 2022. We&#x27;ll go into detail about this security issue below.<p>Important things first, though: We have no reason to believe that anyone was able to obtain your plaintext password because of this vulnerability. However, for the sake of caution, we have reset your Slack password. You will need to set a new Slack password before you can login again.<p>Now, for some technical details — feel free to skip the next two paragraphs if that doesn&#x27;t interest you. When you&#x27;re connected to Slack, we keep your client updated using a websocket. When you have Slack open, the websocket is an always-open stream of behind-the-scenes information, specific to just you and your account, that we use to push new information to your Slack client. When a new message is posted, a new file is uploaded, a new emoji reaction is added, or a new teammate joins, all of this information is sent to you over a websocket. The raw data streamed from Slack&#x27;s servers over the websocket is processed by the Slack client apps, but is not directly visible to users.<p>One of the hidden events we send over the websocket is a notice that a shared invite link was created or revoked. The bug we discovered was in this invite link event along with the information about the shared invite link, the hashed password of the user who created or revoked the link was also included. This information was sent over the websocket to all users of the workspace who were currently connected to Slack. The hash of a password is not the same as the password itself; it is a cryptographic technique to store data in a way that is secure, and cannot be used to log in as you. We use a technique called salting to further protect these hashes. Hashed and salted passwords are secure, but not perfect — they are still subject to being reversed via brute force — which is why we&#x27;ve chosen to reset the passwords of everyone affected.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
