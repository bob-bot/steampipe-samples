And the reason we are yet to make considerable progress on this pressing task could be the limitations of the existing energy systems our society functions on.<p>Centralised energy systems, wherein the production and storage of energy is concentrated geographically and institutionally, give rise to costs and lead to rigidity.<p>41% of the electricity bill you pay goes towards the maintenance of energy delivery infrastructure. And roughly another 15% to the involved retail intermediaries. Using blockchain and peer-to-peer energy trading, we can minimise these components of your electricity bill and in effect make electricity cheaper. Let’s understand how.<p>If hyperlocal renewable energy power plants are set up, we can create ecosystems in every neighbourhood, allowing households to source green energy from a nearby facility. This would significantly reduce the distance energy travels before it powers your home and hence reduces the cost associated with delivery infrastructures.<p>At the same time, the amount of energy lost during delivery, which is currently at 8% in a centralised energy system, will also drop significantly in hyperlocal energy grids.<p>Retail intermediaries are involved in the distribution of energy to match the demand and supply on the network. However, smart contracts and AI can replace these intermediaries, without accounting for 15% of your electricity bill.<p>Based on historical averages and current consumption, the price of energy units can be made dynamic, such that the demand and supply are always equal. This will also allow for consumers to trade units of energy that they aren’t using and get rewarded for minimising their carbon footprint.<p>With intermediaries out of the picture and a super compact delivery infrastructure, the costs of consuming renewable energy are lower. However, in such a scenario there’s little incentive for any organisation to invest in the expensive equipments required to set up power plants. This is where crypto can step in.<p>By decentralising energy systems using utility tokens, only small investments need to be made by everyone using a micro-grid. This way, households can own a part of their neighbourhood’s power plant and get rights to use the energy it produces.<p>With blockchain and crypto, renewable energy can be produced locally, delivered efficiently and consumed responsibly.<p>Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flint.money&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;from-the-mine-4",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
