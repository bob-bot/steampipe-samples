However, I really like the field and have enjoyed some CS-ish online courses. Since I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m learning a lot at work, I&#x27;ve taken it upon myself to bolster my software-related education.<p>The thing is, it&#x27;s all been a bit scattered - some computer architecture, algorithms and data structures, playing around with new languages. As fun as it&#x27;s been, I&#x27;m starting to feel like I could be making better use of my time and interest to build towards something, especially since it&#x27;s all on my own time. So that&#x27;s where my question stems from - what do I build towards now?
 - I use Kotlin and Python at work - is it worth it becoming more deeply familiar with these languages?
 - Or should I focus on software architecture and design patterns, concepts that transcend computer languages to some degree?
 - I could afford to learn more about algorithms and data structures too, is there a good way to do this that isn&#x27;t just memorizing, but also implementing them?
 - Or should I try to learn new technologies that could maybe have uses at work now or later, like containers or databases?<p>I think related to this and also really important is a question about how to best go about these things. For example, do I read books (there&#x27;s plenty of suggested reading that comes up oh HN)? How can I best make use of new knowledge - should I focus on things I can apply easily? Do I jump into open source software? Or should I find a job where the environment is better for teaching young devs? Though I&#x27;d probably have to learn more to prepare for an interview...so maybe there&#x27;s other stuff to focus on first.<p>If anybody has any advice or suggestions it would be greatly appreciated.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
