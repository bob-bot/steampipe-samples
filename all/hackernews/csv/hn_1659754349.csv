32364193,Show HN: Sematic – Convert plain English to structured data,2022-08-06T02:18:48Z,brochington,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN!<p>I would like to share the project that I&#x27;ve been working on for the past six months. It&#x27;s called &quot;Sematic&quot;, and it&#x27;s an NLU API that parses plain english so that devs can really start start to understand the language of our users.<p>In January I was trying to build a &quot;text to bash script&quot; product for my wife, as she is unable to use services like Zapier due to security reasons. I ended up being completely stuck on the first part of the project, which was parsing plain english to a data abstraction that I could code against. The largest problem I had was determining all the relationships between different objects&#x2F;entities.<p>I was hoping that Machine Learning could help me, but after going down some rabbit holes, building models, abusing GPT-3, etc, I found that no matter what, I was going to need proper error correction on the model&#x27;s output. This prompted me to begin studying linguistics, and other no-ML rule based language parsing options. I still feel like there is going to be some ML in this project eventually, but for now I feel like I still have a lot of alpha to go by using some great libs like Duckling, and using old fashioned parsing techniques.<p>My goal is to get Sematic to a point where devs feel comfortable with using it to add Alexa&#x2F;Siri-like text understanding to all kinds of apps and websites. If you have comments or suggestions, I&#x27;m happy to chat more about it. Thank you.",story,https://github.com/brochington/sematic,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
