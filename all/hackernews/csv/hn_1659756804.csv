I thought for a while people were spending their time with family and friends, going out to bars and clubs, preparing for brief travel or weekend adventures, something along those lines... but when I encounter them on Monday and inquire, it turns out they didn&#x27;t do anything different at all. Didn&#x27;t sleep early, didn&#x27;t go out partying, didn&#x27;t do anything substantially different than Wednesday and Thursday nights, yet the Internet is dead.<p>Am I imagining it?
