As a consumer it seems like there are rarely any options among incumbents and so the only way to go electric in a wide range of industries is to make a large purchase from a startup that may or may not exist in a few years and doesn’t have any of the widespread dealer support that incumbents have built. What is taking them so long?<p>For example: John Deere announced an electric tractor in… 2016. It’s now 2022 and this tractor is still nowhere to be found. It’s the same everywhere I look. Options to go electric are seemingly as limited today as they have ever been in everything but cars (and even then it is only marginally better).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32371928,Idea: Aerial (above ground) street lanes for flying vehicles,2022-08-06T21:56:37Z,velovoy,1,false,false,4,"[32372035,32371936]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"It looks like aerial personal vehicles are taking off both literally and figuratively (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28982993). Has there been any work done on creating aerial street lanes above the ground (but lower than small aircraft altitudes)? I was imagining something like an invisible layered grid that a person can see on their flying vehicle&#x27;s computer screen, Google Glasses, or on their helmet&#x27;s shield with AR. This could solve traffic gridlock if personal flying vehicles could use up layers of airspace above street level but below small aircraft levels (1000 ft). You just ascend to a higher altitude and fly along the aerial street route to buy groceries or send a package at the post office. We would be able to travel in not just 2D (x- and y-planes) but in 3D as well (z-plane). Maybe a high-rise building can have landing docks and stores at certain altitudes? This would eliminate annoying urban sprawl, like Los Angeles where it takes like 5 hours (gridlock) to drive from the east side to west.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
