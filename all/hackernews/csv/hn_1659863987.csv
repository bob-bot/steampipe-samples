The students need to be able to start the project from any chapters they want.<p>Ideally, I should be able to provide partial&#x2F;full solutions as a repository (or an archive) to students. So far, I&#x27;ve separated the work into two directories per chapter (one for the full solution, one for the partial).<p>The problem is - if I want to modify something in any place and want to keep it consistent, I need to make a change in 8 directories.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about the best way to organize it but can&#x27;t think of any approach that would be simple and would allow me to change the code in a single place.<p>I was thinking about submodules, but the projects are not clear-cut, sometimes the same files will be modified in multiple chapters.<p>I would hugely appreciate any thoughts you might have!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
