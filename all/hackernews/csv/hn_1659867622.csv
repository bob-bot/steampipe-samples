It&#x27;s an ORM like abstraction layer for TypeScript to work with API&#x27;s through the model reflection.<p>In the first release we covered JSON:API specification. It is available as plugin and allows you easily connect to any backend API which follows described conventions. Besides it provides extension points for different filtering and pagination strategies which might be used by a server.<p>It&#x27;s been a long way since idea to implementation. It will be really cool if you can try things out and give your feedback. Feel free to open any issues.<p>Thanks for your time and have a great day! ;)",story,https://github.com/dipscope/EntityStore.TS,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
