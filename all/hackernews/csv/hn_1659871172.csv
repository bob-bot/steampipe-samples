I am working for a company which does provide services online but refuses to enter this system. The only source of income is premium subscription for the service.<p>As consequence, the company struggles to make money in the west.<p>Of course this might be related to a million of reasons, but I started wondering what would happen if we needed to pay for online services.<p>my questions for you:
- do you pay for Netflix, prime ou disney+?
- do you pay youtube premium?
- would you pay to use stackoverflow?
- why wouldn&#x27;t you pay to Medium?<p>I think we are used to have content for free, but increasing costs in content production and maintance are stressing the limits of what can be earned through publicity.<p>Unfortunately, it is also really easy for content to stolen or shove into another site. eg udemy courses which are basically videos from other people.
This means that many authors cannot rely to receive a fair amount for their work.<p>Thank you for those who shared their thoughts in advance.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
