The main focus is the protecting privacy as it is the primary reason for other challenges including government participation.
Integrated efforts from the government, civil society and private sectors would play a vital role in protecting the following values given below in to prevent IoT networks and devices from getting hampered.
1. Scalability: Billions of internet-enabled devices get connected in a huge network, large volumes of data are needed to be processed. The system that stores, analyses the data from these IoT devices needs to be scalable. In present, the era of IoT evolution everyday objects are connected with each other via the Internet.
The raw data obtained from these devices needs big data analytics and cloud storage for interpretation of useful data.<p>2. Interoperability: Technological standards in most areas are still fragmented. These technologies need to be converged. Which would help us (the Dev team at the Delphexion Systems) in establishing a common framework and the standard for the IoT networks and devices to ensure a premium user-centric security for individuals and industries alike. As the standardization process is lacking (at the moment), interoperability of IoT with legacy devices should be considered critical. This lack of interoperability is preventing us to to move towards the vision of truly connected everyday interoperable smart objects<p>3. Designs Based Challenge: With the development in technology design challenges are increasing at a faster rate.
There have been issues regarding design like computational power, limited energy and limited memory which need to be sorted out.<p>4. Security and personal privacy: There has been no research in security vulnerability and it&#x27;s improvement and solutions.
It must ensure Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of personal data of patients.
NOTE: The Delphexion Systems is at the forefront of research and development of the practical solution by which security and personal privacy can be ensured in all types of IoT networks ranging across all latency and industries.<p>5. Safety of Patients: Most IoT devices are left unattended, as they are connected with real-world objects.
If used on people as wearable devices, any technical error in security can be life-threatening for patients.<p>WHAT IT MEAN FOR YOU:
the last decade has seen a surge in cyber attacks and data breaches, grid attacks and other events that still point to the same problem: SECURITY!.
Billions of dollars have been stolen and precious data have leaked into the wrong hands.
So what&#x27;s next?<p>The DELPHEXION SYSTEMS Alienforce prototype which is codenamed Project Ngoma is a holistic approach and a research geared towards using a user-centric algorithm and delegated security infrastructure to ensure that security is built in uncrackable layers in which the power belongs to the creator of such data.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32377826,Show HN: Apprise v1.0.0 – A lightweight all-in-one notification solution,2022-08-07T16:51:08Z,l2g,1,false,false,2,"[32378015,32377926]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"I introduced Hacker News to Apprise back when it was just an experiment (and supported just 30 or so notification services at the time). Now supporting more then 85+ services and with a ton of built in features, I officially created it&#x27;s first stable v1.0.0 release marking a major milestone for the project.<p>Apprise doesn&#x27;t compete with other notification services out there; instead it just acts as a proxy (or master switchboard) to support handling messages to them. It&#x27;s a means of decoupling notification support from the systems that want to provide them. The idea is to adopt Apprise into your environment, and then you no longer have to worry about adding&#x2F;removing support for new services as the come along and deprecating the ones that go away.<p>The way it works is that every service out there maps to a `schema:&#x2F;&#x2F;credentials&#x2F;?optional_configuration`. You just need to define the schemas you use, and then you can already use Apprise. Check out the list of the services available today here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise#supported-notifications"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise#supported-notifications</a><p>Apprise is 100% open source (MIT Licensed).  It has an acompanied API I built for those who want to centralize their configuration (found here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise-api</a>).<p>Some reasons you may also all find it useful:<p><pre><code>  - It works perfectly with legacy servers (supporting even Python 2.7).  So this fits system admins using older systems such as CentOS 6+
  - It has a complete API that developers, devops, and administrators alike can leverage allowing them to control the notifications in their environments.
  - It supports configuration files allowing you to securely hide your credentials and map them to simple tags like `family`, `devops`, `marketing`, etc. There is no limit to the number of tag assignments. It supports a simple TEXT (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;config_text) based configuration, as well as a more advanced and configurable YAML (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;config_yaml) based one.
  - It sends all notifications asynchronously optimizing setups where there are many end-points to deliver to.
  - It supports inputs are of MARKDOWN, HTML, and TEXT and can easily convert between these depending on the endpoint. For example: HTML provided input would be converted to TEXT before passing it along as a text message. However the same HTML content provided would not be converted if the endpoint accepted it as such (such as Telegram, or Email). 
  - It supports breaking large messages into smaller ones to fit the upstream service. Hence a text message (160 characters) or a Tweet (280 characters) would be constructed for you if the notification you sent was larger.
  - It supports file attachments too. So feel free to pass along an image, PDF, etc if the destination supports it.
  - It can easily allow you to write your own custom notifications and&#x2F;or simply leverage Apprise as routing service to perform admin tasks for you.  See here for more details: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;caronc&#x2F;apprise&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;decorator_notify
  - It has 100% code based test coverage. :)
</code></pre>
I hope to continue to add more services (and break 100+ supported services someday). I also hope some of you find it useful for your own project solution!",story,https://github.com/caronc/apprise,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
