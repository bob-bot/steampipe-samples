He seems to be some kind of prodigy when it comes to computers. He has been messing with computers and software for a long time. He is always mentioning some random project he is building in a new language, or some weird aspect of computing he is exploring. Hes made his own games, his own game engines, done stuff in assembly, C, C++, C#, python, javascript, etc. etc. all off his own bat.
Also he is very creative and makes art and music and weird 3d animations.<p>He&#x27;s in what he calls college now, which is a sort of halfway between school and university, coming from his current college he can do a uni course in systems administration, afaik this is his only choice and the most computery uni course he can do.<p>My advice for him is basically...
1. Do some kind of computery uni course
2. Get a computery job in an EU country and go live there.<p>* What would your advice be?<p>* Can you go into any more detail than I have done?<p>* Are any of you Russian emigrants working in computing? What was your story?<p>Thanks!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
