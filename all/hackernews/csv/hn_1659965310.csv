The most common solutions are to include a data table or attempt to describe the chart in alt text, often resulting in a subpar user experience.<p>I’m a blind software developer and one of the contributors to Chart2Music (C2M), an open source JavaScript&#x2F;TypeScript package which tries to simplify creating accessible charts. It works with pretty much any charting library to add interactive sonification and verbal output through screen reading software.<p>The goals of the project are:
* Allow chart authors to make accessible charts without having to understand sonification best practices or how to force screen readers to speak using ARIA
* Allow blind consumers to explore charts and look for trends in the data without having to navigate large data tables
* Work alongside charting libraries so authors can continue to control the visuals using the tools that they know best
* Be easy to use in the majority of cases but allow deeper customization and integration when desired<p>Now that C2M is stable and ready to be used, I’m interested in finding a way to integrate it with some of the system dashboards, so I can monitor server resources like CPU and memory utilization for my side projects.",story,https://www.chart2music.com/docs/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
