It does this by extracting different elements such as tags and folders from a collection of writing then presenting those elements via in-context autocomplete.<p>- Makes the collection of writing more useful by including notation elements such as events, beans [2] and formulas to support computing within the writing itself.<p>A while back I released sowhat, the language supporting Tap [3]. Sowhat and the companion editor are, together, a cornerstone of Tap. Tap is a system for collecting writing and other digital matter.<p>The editor here can be used in conjunction with sowhat to build your own tools. Or, it can provide a foundation to augment and enhance Tap.<p>My goal is to open source as much of Tap as possible because:<p>- It&#x27;s fun to build with other people<p>- It should be as easy as possible for someone to customize their Tap experience. There&#x27;s no way to accommodate all the UXs one might want within Tap. These tools are intended to enable a developer to create their own experiences.<p>- For those that use Tap but the then leave, a person&#x27;s exported notes can maintain their original organization and meaning.<p>- Opens a path for others to provide feedback and enhancements to the open source tools and Tap itself.<p>0. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tatatap-com&#x2F;sowhat-editor"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tatatap-com&#x2F;sowhat-editor</a>, demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tatatap-com.github.io&#x2F;sowhat-editor&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tatatap-com.github.io&#x2F;sowhat-editor&#x2F;</a><p>1. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tatatap-com&#x2F;sowhat"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tatatap-com&#x2F;sowhat</a><p>2. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tatatap-com&#x2F;sowhat#beans"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tatatap-com&#x2F;sowhat#beans</a><p>3. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tatatap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tatatap.com</a>",story,https://tatatap-com.github.io/sowhat-editor/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

A few classes in high school&#x2F;college but my bachelor&#x27;s degree was in Industrial Systems Engineering.<p>At my jobs I&#x27;ve mostly been around other self taught people with degrees in other non-cs fields.  A couple bootcamp guys with no degree, and 1 ivy league guy with a cs degree.  So my exposure to how important college is might be skewed.<p>A friend&#x27;s kid recently asked me how important getting a degree was and I couldn&#x27;t really put a good answer to that as most of my friends&#x2F;colleagues are self taught and not using their degree.<p>Granted I learned good technical writing and I guess engineering team work, but is the price of college worth that?

I have a great job, great coworkers, a fantastic manager who gives me everything I need, work in my ideal environment, and I’m still struggling to find motivation to complete my tasks, let alone to the standard that I know I could. I have very strong feelings about making things good and doing my best, so while half assing things like this is rewarding in the short term, in the long term I just feel like I’m doing bad work and not living up to my potential. I should say (I think) my teammates love me and my managers are happy with my work and keep giving me raises and promotions. But (while my family and I certainly appreciate the money) it kind of makes me feel bad because I feel like they’re going to realize how badly I’m doing at some point. I don’t have some kind of feudal loyalty to the company, but I do feel a loyalty to my managers and coworkers who have helped me a lot and always treated me very well. I don’t want to leave this job because it’s great and I’m almost certain whatever other job I get would be objectively worse, but I really feel like I need to change something so I can feel good about my work again.<p>I think earlier in my career I had this drive to prove myself that was a big motivator for me to to my best, and now that I’m more confident in my skills I don’t have that motivation anymore.<p>Anyway, I know there’s nothing more annoying than someone complaining about how good their situation is, but I would really appreciate advice from anyone reading who’s been in a similar situation.<p>Thanks for reading.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
