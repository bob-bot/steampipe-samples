I have so many memories &amp; friendships on this account which are irreplaceable..<p>I was hacked through an old email address attached to my FB account through an expired domain.<p>I was on my email as it was happening - I could see notifications of my password being changed &amp; suddenly I was locked out as they posted illegal content.<p>The hackers placed ads which were charged through my PayPal account which fortunately I was able to stop. I was able to regain ownership of my account through a lengthy process of providing my ID.<p>I am now however stuck! I have tried everything &amp; on 4 August I received notification from Facebook that I ‘only have 8 days left to take action’ before my account is permanently disabled as I did not finish the steps to disagree with their recent decision to suspend my account.<p>However.. when I attempt to access my account it tells me ‘Review Requested’ If we find that your posts of comments didn’t follow our Community Standards, your account will remain disabled.<p>I really don’t know what else to do &amp; would be so grateful for any advice?<p>With much thanks!<p>Jolie",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
