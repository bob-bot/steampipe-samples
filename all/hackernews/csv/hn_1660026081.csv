I tried CBT one time, approx 15 years ago, for approx 8-10 sessions (including hypnosis), and - besides being extremely expensive - led to no positive results.<p>I am now retired, and after a [working] life of missing all the fun and keeping my companion from enjoying such, also, I decided to see if I could attempt a self-healing of sorts. I borrowed a book I found closest to the subject (&quot;Overcoming fear of heights&quot; - Martin Antony, PhD et.al.), but I would still like to ask: has anyone out there fixed on their own such a problem, especially after so many years of &quot;twisted&quot; brain processing of space issues?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
