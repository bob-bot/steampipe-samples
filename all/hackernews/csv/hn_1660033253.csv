When the customers encounter a product they have never seen before, they will look for contextual clues to help them figure our what it is, who is it for, and why they should care. Taken together, the messaging, pricing, features, branding and customers create context. Context can completely transform how we think about the product.<p>Example: A world famous violinist once played on a busy subway in Washington. Many people (1070) passed him by, very few (only 7) bothered to listen to him and one even thought of complaining to police as he thought the music was too loud. In the end a violinist that earned $300 per person in a concert, earned only $32.17.<p>The detailed tweet on this topic is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lnkd.in&#x2F;dMueDvs8<p>source : April - obviously awesome",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
