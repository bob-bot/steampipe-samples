32396023,Show HN: Learn any language by speaking to a Language Model,2022-08-09T10:19:49Z,Hadjimina,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi all,<p>Last year I wanted to learn how to SPEAK greek. I did not really need to learn perfect grammar or know how to spell every word perfectly (fun fact: greek has three letters that are pronounced like &quot;i&quot;). Since private tutoring is expensive, dependent on the teacher&#x27;s schedule, and 1-1 conversations don&#x27;t scale, I started working on Quazel.<p>Quazel is a language learning website where you can talk in any* language with an AI(aka language model) in different scenes. You do so by using your device&#x27;s microphone and hearing the AI&#x27;s response through your speakers. There is a lot more to it, but I&#x27;ll let you discover that for yourselves.<p>My team and I built this tool in a relatively short timeframe, so you should have no problem finding some bugs.<p>Ask: If any of you are currently trying to learn a new language, I would love to better tailor Quazel to your needs. Send me an email: philipp.hadjimina@berkeley.edu<p>Cheers
Philipp<p>*: Currently, we only support Dutch, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese (from Portugal), and Swedish.",story,https://www.quazel.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
