What I have come to realize is that Python is just as complicated as Java! However it is much much easier to get started with.<p>Java is aimed squarely at professional devs and requires a lot of tooling and support.
Python requires almost nothing (interpreter + editor + a basic understanding of lists&#x2F;dicts and control flow) to get started.<p><i>But</i> do a big project with a large team and you&#x27;ll quickly discover the rough edges and debates - a few that have come up lately for me at work - typing or no typing, oop or functional? pytest or unittest? poetry vs pipenv vs ... ? Occasional runtime errors. Project layout and organization (makes me miss maven sometimes).
Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I really enjoy working in Python but I believe it would be a niche language if it were not so approachable to the beginner.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
