I applied, 24 days later i received canned response about &quot;not moving forward&quot;. I didnt make anything out of it.
Couple months passed, I see the offer is still up, accepting applicants.<p>I decided to check out the person who rejected me on linkedin and found that its not a white guy with &quot;Diversity and Inclusion&quot; in his title, and &quot;Diversity and inclusion is one of my foundational pillars, and I&#x27;m driven to introduce more diversity to the tech world.&quot;<p>Without going into too much detail, I suspect my rejection might be caused by &quot;diversity and inclusion&quot; part of his title, not the &quot;Technical Recruiter&quot; part.<p>I have pretty good record of getting invited to all 2nd+ stages of recruitements even if my experience does not fit as perfect as this time, hence my surprise and investigation.<p>Any ideas how could i approach the subject to be at least evaluated when it comes to culture fit, technical abilities, teamwork, by people who are competent and will potentially work with me, instead of resume shuffler?<p>Write to a senior recruiter on linkedin and ask if he could evaluate my CV personally?
Give up?
Forge my CV to include non-white photo (or remove it altogether) and pretend that my camera is broken until i get past him?
Is there any chance to get past this filter?<p>I would rather not start any relationship with a lie. Having said that, desperate times...<p>I really like the company, product (ive used it in the past), offer is very suitable for me, so i wouldnt want to pass it lightly.<p>Any advice appreciated.
