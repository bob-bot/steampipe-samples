32409980,Launch HN: Genti Audio – Stories and podcasts in African languages,2022-08-10T10:47:50Z,eke_uche,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi all, 
Eke here, co-founder of Genti Audio. Genti Audio is a mobile app for streaming and downloading Africa-focused audiobooks, stories, and podcasts in regional and local African languages.<p>Our Story<p>In September 2021, my sister and I sat down to work on an audio show exploring Nigeria’s cultural and linguistic diversity. As we began to put the show together, we realized that our target audience- Nigerians and Africans in both urban and rural areas, were not heavily present on any of the major audio platforms for this type of content. Recognizing this, we decided to first fix this distribution gap, and so the idea for Genti was born.<p>From just an idea, we began pooling resources and soon started developing our beta app. And after months of hard work building, scouring for content, and raising funds from supportive friends and family, we are very excited to announce the launch of our mobile app. We will continue to improve the app and roll out more features over the next 4 months. Download the App now on Google Play or the Apple App Store and start listening!<p>Our Mission<p>At Genti, our mission is to amplify African stories and voices to entertain, educate, and enrich lives. In line with our mission, we’ll spend the next 3 - 6 months getting the best entertaining and educative African audio content out there and curating for our users. We also believe that for every African story told there are hundreds waiting to be told, and that’s why we’ve begun working on developing engaging original content available exclusively on our platform. Genti is committed to playing a vital role in developing and deepening audio storytelling on the continent.<p>Our App<p>To download the app, visit the Genti website, or download directly from Google Play and the Apple App store and start listening!<p>If you’ve got a podcast, audiobook, or story you’d like to upload on Genti, please send an email to ojiugo@gentimedia.com and we’ll be in touch. We’d also love to get feedback from you on your experience with the Genti App.",story,https://gentimedia.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
