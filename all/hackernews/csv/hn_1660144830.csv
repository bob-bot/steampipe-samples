32413070,Launch HN: Sematic (YC S22) – Open-source framework to build ML pipelines faster,2022-08-10T14:56:50Z,neutralino1,12,false,false,3,"[32413308,32413133]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN – I’m Emmanuel, founder of Sematic (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sematic.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sematic.dev</a>). Sematic is an open-source framework to prototype and productionize end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS) pipelines in days instead of weeks or months. The idea is to do for ML development what Rails and Heroku did for web development.<p>I started my career searching for Supersymmetry and the Higgs boson on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, then moved to industry. I spent the last four years building ML infrastructure at Cruise. In both academia and industry, I witnessed researchers, data scientists, and ML engineers spending an absurd share of their time building makeshift tooling, stitching up infrastructure, and battling obscure systems, instead of focusing on their core area of expertise: extracting insights and predictions from data.<p>This was painfully apparent at Cruise where the ML Platform team needed to grow linearly with the number of users to support and models to ship to the car. What should have just taken a click (e.g. retraining a model when world conditions change – COVID parklets, road construction sites, deployment to new cities) often required weeks of painstaking work. Existing tools for prototyping and productionizing ML&#x2F;DS models did not enable developers to become autonomous and tackle new projects instead of babysitting current ones.<p>For example, a widely adopted tool such as Kubeflow Pipelines requires users to learn an obscure Python API, package and deploy their code and dependencies by hand, and does not offer exhaustive tracking and visualization of artifacts beyond simple metadata.<p>In order to become autonomous, users needed a dead-simple way to iterate seamlessly between local and cloud environments (change code, validate locally, run at scale in the cloud, repeat) and visualize objects (metrics, plots, datasets, configs) in a UI. Strong guarantees around dependency packaging, traceability of artifact lineage, and reproducibility would have to be provided out-of-the-box.<p>Sematic lets ML&#x2F;DS developers build and run pipelines of arbitrary complexity with nothing more than minimalistic Python APIs. Business logic, dynamic pipeline graphs, configurations, resource requirements, etc. — all with only Python. We are bringing the lovable aspects of Jupyter Notebooks (iterative development, visualizations) to the actual pipeline.<p>How it works: Sematic resolves dynamic nested graphs of pipeline steps (simple Python functions) and intercepts all inputs and outputs of each step to type-check, serialize, version, and track them. Individual steps are orchestrated as Kubernetes jobs according to required resources (e.g. GPU, high-memory), and all tracking and visualization information is surfaced in a modern UI. Build assets (user code, third-party dependencies, drivers, static libraries) are packaged and shipped to remote workers at runtime, which enables a fast and seamless iterative development experience.<p>Sematic lets you achieve results much faster by not wasting time on packaging dependencies, foraging for output artifacts to visualize, investigating obscure failures in black-box container jobs, bookkeeping configurations, writing complex YAML templates to run multiple experiments, etc.<p>It can run on a local machine or be deployed to leverage cloud resources (e.g. GPUs, high-memory instances, map&#x2F;reduce clusters, etc.) with minimal external dependencies: Python, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes.<p>Sematic is open-source and free to use locally or self-hosted in your own cloud. We will provide a SaaS offering to enable access to cloud resources without the hassle of maintaining a cloud deployment.
To get started, simply run `$ pip install sematic; sematic start`.

We’re excited to share what we’ve been working on, the Lumina Desk (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getlumina.com&#x2F;desk"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getlumina.com&#x2F;desk</a>).<p>Last January, we founded Lumina with the mission of building the next-generation workspace.<p>We started off by launching a product called the Lumina Webcam, essentially a modern webcam that uses software to make you look good.<p>Building hardware is hard, and it’s been no different for us. We ran an Indiegogo campaign in September that raised ~$700k, scrambled to figure out hardware production (encountering every obstacle you can imagine - customs, supplier issues, parts incompatibilities), and chewed through enough glass in order to start shipping in December. But between then and now, we’ve scaled up production and have gotten some great customer feedback.<p>Next: we’re building the desk. We set out to rethink this centuries-old product and figure out how to make it into a more useful, productivity enhancing tool.<p>To start, we’re viewing the desk as a digital device, not just a mechanical one. Your desk could be an extension of your digital workspace; a complement to your phone and computer.<p>So we’re designing the Lumina Desk to have an embedded display. The thought is: from your desk, you’ll be able to check your calendar, receive call and chat notifications, and more. Or you can install (or build your own) apps to further customize it.<p>Think of the browser tabs that you keep open to occasionally glance at – the ones with dashboards or calendars or news feeds. These can now be in your desk, playing a role similar to a paper calendar or newspaper, but now in a seamlessly digital format.<p>With a digital desk, it can also play an active role in your health. Like a way to schedule times to sit or stand, or sensors that detect ergonomic input, or an in-desk dashboard that shows you your health stats.<p>Finally, we surveyed all the desks on the market and were surprised that few of them had the core fundamentals people want. How many desks have enough cable storage to hide all your cables? Enough usb and 110v sockets to power your workstation? Enough wireless charging space to charge all your wireless devices? These features should be tablestakes for any professional desk.<p>We’re in the early days of the desk, and there’s still room to shape the development of the product. If you have ideas on how we make the ultimate workspace, reach out and let us know. If you might be interested in building apps, we’d love to talk to you about building our first few apps.<p>Thanks so much for reading this. There’s a ton of work to be done, and your early support means a lot to us.",story,https://getlumina.com/desk,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
