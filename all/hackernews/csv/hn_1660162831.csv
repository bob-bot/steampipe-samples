Next I moved on to MoneyWiz (and is what I&#x27;m currently using) and unfortunately I&#x27;m finding similar issues. The app is extremely slow (5 → 10s per transfer) and I&#x27;m starting to notice more bugs &amp; inconsistencies - currency conversions aren&#x27;t consistent, deselected accounts&#x27; transactions randomly appearing etc.<p>Quite honestly, me an my SO spend more time trying to &quot;have the numbers line up&quot; rather than actually using our budget to our advantage.<p>Why is it so difficult to find a stable and reliable tool - especially in the personal finance sector?<p>In terms of functionality that I&#x27;m looking for, I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;m asking too much: - native envelope budgeting (with envelope convenience features would be even better e.g. transfers, easy distribution of money, calculations ...) - multi currency support (ideally with static currency override) - categories with at least 1 level for organizing - split transactions (across multiple categories) - tags (for a 3rd dimension of reporting) - MacOS (or webapp) + having an iOS app would be ideal - EU bank account sync would be fantastic - Custom reporting - the cherry on the top (for a web app) would be an API for me to tinker with (not required).<p>I&#x27;ve been having a look at YNAB and it looks very promising. It pretty much ticks all my boxes except for tagging and my bank is not supported for syncing.<p>I&#x27;ve also thought of building a spreadsheet myself, but just not convinced it&#x27;s worth the maintenance &amp; hassle + how easy it will be to implement the above.
