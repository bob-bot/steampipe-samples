After finishing, I eventually found my way to joining the founding team of an early stage startup where for the next 6 years I ran around like a headless chicken. Whether for lack of education, experience, mentorship, or volition, I learned very little about how to systematically build a product and business. The whole experience was taxing.<p>I left the company to spend the next couple years working on my mental health. It became clear that much of my ineffectiveness was due to deeply-rooted fears, self-hatred, and maladaptive behaviors due to severe childhood trauma.<p>Now at 36, I do find myself in a much better place. I&#x27;ve arrived at more of an understanding of who I am, my values, the kind of life I want to live. But I do feel as if I&#x27;ve squandered almost a decade of professional potential. I have good intuitive product and design sense, but have very very little in the way of effective skills, such as understanding and facilitating a product development process. Additionally, I have a very small network, if at all.<p>Where do I go from here? Do I seek a mentor &#x2F; life coach to help me build a practical path forward? Back to school? And where do I begin building a professional network? Will a company even look in my direction at this point?<p>Thanks.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
