My age (40s) and experience (20+ years in IT) was definitely helpful in keeping me resilient through the process, and I&#x27;m extremely fortunate to have landed a senior IT leadership role that I love.<p>BUT I have come away from this entire ordeal a touch jaded and syndical towards much corporate America and how people are treated within the job search process (almost all other job seekers I spoke to had very similar experiences) . These are several key takeaways from my job hunt that I wanted to get some feedback&#x2F;input from the HN community on potentially why this is happening and why it seems to be so prevalent across so many companies today:<p>1. Of the 13 staff-level (not recruiters) virtual interviews I had where no job offer was given, 9 of them that moved onto second interviews, 4 to third, I only received follow-up &quot;dear john&quot; communication from 2 of them.  Ironically these were both from first-round interview companies.  Is it normal practice to ghost applicants at the staff-level interview process?  In brutal self reflection I even recorded several of the interviews and shared them with friends in senior leadership positions to ask for coaching advice and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.<p>2. Communications, especially logistical planning for interviews, was at times borderline comical.  This is not hyperbole when I say that more often than not I would need to write follow-up emails after an email communication would go unresponded to for over a week, sometimes longer, sometimes not at all.<p>3. I have, as of today, well over 30 ATL optimized applications still sitting in &quot;applications purgatory&quot; with many large fortune 500 companies.  Most of these applications are from 3-4 months ago.  The fact that these companies have no automated purge&#x2F;rejection process seems bizarre to me.<p>Help me out HN.  How does your company handle communication etiquette?  Am I out of touch to be expecting email replies to relevant, time sensitive information within days, not weeks?  Why is ghosting tolerated, or is it normal now and I&#x27;m just expecting too much from this new generation?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
