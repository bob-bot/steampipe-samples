For example: Garage Sales, roaming Food Trucks, and the locations of vendors and water stations at outdoor music festivals.<p>The long term goal is for most of the maps to be created by the community. That said, to fix the chicken-and-egg problem, there are several automated first-party maps that contain fun data. For example, there are maps for San Francisco police, Fire Department, and 311 calls, and Earthquake epicenters from all around the world.<p>If all this information were to always be visible then the user would certainly be overwhelmed! They would also see a lot of stuff they just don&#x27;t care about. Instead, Map Buddy users subscribe to the maps they care about, and their home map is a composite of all of these maps. This means you might see coffee shops, Dreamforce after parties, and Burning Man art, while your friend might see coffee shops, the local chamber of commerce members, and doggy bag stations.<p>Map Buddy is available as a mobile-friendly web app, iOS app, and Android app:<p>- Web: [<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.mapbuddy.app&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.mapbuddy.app&#x2F;)"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.mapbuddy.app&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.mapbuddy.app&#x2F;)</a>

It has customers who use it to map partnering business and embed the map as an iframe on their website. Map Buddy only shows exactly the locations that have been added. This differs from other tools that show your map entries, plus ads for coffee shops and the local Target.<p>Most map posts also support threaded conversations (this is configurable per post). This allows people to, for example, discuss an earthquake that they felt, a robbery that they overheard, or even express their love for their favorite tree without having to carve their initials on it.<p>Here are some examples of the features of Map Buddy:<p>- Conversation screen for a large bay area earthquake:

They are a STEM Ed organization that partners with local companies in the space, such as planetariums and libraries. Students install the app and visit the locations in real life. Once there, they can check-in using the app. My customer then rewards students who check-in the most by raffling off prizes.<p>At this point almost everything is free. The only thing that&#x27;s really charged for is manual data entry (basically cleaning up and importing a spreadsheet of locations) and the check-in feature (they need a TOS page and must be vetted since emails are shared).<p>This project was previously announced on HN as &quot;Radar Chat&quot;. Since then, the app has evolved in many ways, especially in going from a focus on users that create messages to companies that create curated maps.",story,https://mapbuddy.app/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

And because these new clients are currently using a variety of competitor software products, or their own in-house system of Excel sheets and TXT files, we end up hand-migrating everyone, which is both error prone and time consuming.<p>We have an in-house system to help eliminate errors in the migrations, but it is still EXTREMELY time consuming to build the migration scripts and vet the data, and we still end up with errored data from time to time.<p>What I&#x27;m hoping to find is some program (Free, Paid, whatever) or framework (Any language is fine) that can help with the migration process. Ideally this is a program that we can point at a data source (Even if we first have to hand move things into a proper database engine) and then write queries or transformations to get that data into our required format. Even better if the utility can keep track of data that we didn&#x27;t move and show us what tables&#x2F;columns were not moved so that we can audit the migrations in order to verify that all required data is being moved.<p>With all of the SaaS products in the world, I&#x27;d be surprised if nothing exists in this space, but so far in my lunch break googling I&#x27;ve come up empty.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
