32431133,Ask HN: Would a service to ask proven founders reg. question async be valuable?,2022-08-11T20:13:00Z,kiddz,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"TLDR:  I just wrote a buddy of mine who successfully sold his last company for 100+ ML for some advice on my start-up.  He smartly suggested that I could record a Loom video and send it over for him to respond async.  Ironically, this sparked the idea of, &quot;wow, I&#x27;d love to have a two of three proven founders who I could report back to regularly for their guidance.&quot;<p>So I&#x27;m asking HN. . . do you know of any services like this or would you find this valuable?  I could imagine people asking things like, how should I start a drip email campaign, what do you think of this onboarding strategy, a friend&#x27;s dad wants to invest in my start-up, should I pivot. . . the thousands of various questions I think we all have.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear what people think who consider themselves successful and if they would be open to giving such advice async, and what people think who would like such advice.  Last thought, I pay $199 per month for a nutritionist to help me lose weight and she follows my meal tracking. . . I see this as sort of similar.  She can give me some advice on edge cases, or just boost my spirits when I feel like I should not have had those two margaritas during the Sunday brunch.
