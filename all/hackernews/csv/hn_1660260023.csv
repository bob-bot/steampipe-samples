32432555,Ask HN: Having a good career without meaningful work relationships?,2022-08-11T22:24:16Z,djellybeans,2,false,false,2,"[32432954,32432806]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"Trying to build meaningful relationships at work stresses me out. But also, I don&#x27;t want my career to stay bad from the lack of good work relationships. I just don&#x27;t want to be stressed, neither in the short run nor in the long run.<p>I treat interactions with people at work as being very &quot;in the moment&quot;, very transactional, just doing the minimum to realize the goals of our work and the company. I don&#x27;t invest time to build relationships at work beyond that. With my group of friends, I don&#x27;t see them at work. I don&#x27;t have many friends but with those that do, I still care about. Far less stressful compared to building genuine relationships at work.<p>Might be something to do with the workplace setting and money being involved in work. I don&#x27;t get how transactional behavior in professional settings became taboo when money is at the center of most of it anyways. Nothing personal, just business.<p>My life shouldn&#x27;t revolve around work or the people in them, but I do still want it to be stable enough in order to financially support my life outside of work. Can I have it both? In other words, low-investment, high stability work, in tech. Maybe that&#x27;s a unicorn job in tech, I don&#x27;t know.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
