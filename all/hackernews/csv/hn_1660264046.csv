It caused the window to go completely blank and the beachball went rolling. Resizing it back to be a bit narrower fixed the issue. It seems that the max width that Edge on Mac can take is 8192px. I found that out with the following AppleScript[1]:<p><pre><code>  tell application &quot;System Events&quot;
   set appOfInterest to &quot;Microsoft Edge&quot;
   set windowXY to size of the first window of application process appOfInterest
   display notification (item 1 of windowXY as text) &amp; &quot; x &quot; &amp; (item 2 of windowXY as text) with title &quot;Frontmost window of &quot; &amp; appOfInterest &amp; &quot;:&quot;
  end tell
</code></pre>
After that I tried the same with Terminal.app, but this one seems to be able to take just about any size. Then I tried checking the same with Firefox, but Firefox crashed completely and I don&#x27;t have the patience to restart it repeatedly to find out what the threshold is.<p>Anyway, funny conclusion is: web browsers have quite narrow acceptable operating conditions for their window sizes, where by &quot;narrow&quot; I mean: it&#x27;s just a couple seconds of dragging with a mouse, nothing outlandish (although also quite an improbable use-case in the real world).<p>[1]: Found here: &lt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robservatory.com&#x2F;how-to-display-the-size-of-an-apps-frontmost-window&#x2F;&gt;",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
