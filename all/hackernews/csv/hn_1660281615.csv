Well you have to do whatever it takes to make sure that users are occupied and they don&#x27;t leave you.<p>But the social media has become influencer media. Literally everyone is an influencer and playing the great online game. Now we know much more about the Kardashians than we know about our friends. And instead of talking to friends, we talk to strangers on Omegle (which is kind of fun). But we can&#x27;t make strong relationships with that.<p>How many of you have best friends whom you can trust blindly ( like Joey and Chandler ) ? Not many I guess. what started as a way to find friends and deepen the friendship faded with the lore of being an influencer.
And guess we are going in full circle here. Just like everything else.
There is a rise of dummy-phone , record sales of vinyl cassettes and cycles.<p>So I guess there will be a return to friendster and myspace. And we can kind of see that. With the rise of BeReal and Locket which tells you to share your true life with your friends. But it&#x27;s kind of boring tbh.<p>Instagram rose because of the filters which made everyone a &quot;good&quot; photographer. Tik-tok rose because it&#x27;s an entertainment cheetos.

You iteratively and gradually keep getting better. But I always felt in my gut it was wrong, and now I&#x27;ve an example to share:<p>Fortnite!<p>When it got popular around 2018, I got really into it and saw the progression of it getting &quot;better&quot;!<p>EPIC, the company who made fortnite, started to listen to gamers and it ruined the game. Game is pretty hard, it&#x27;s not just a shooter game, it has building mechanics - you can build walls to protect yourself... an average good player (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ajM4OifohOk?t=42), (the really good players are playing at 240hz and you can&#x27;t even see all the moves in 60hz youtube video.)<p>I wanted a practice mode, they made it.<p>I wanted they&#x27;d give us unlimited resources to practice, they made it so. I wished they&#x27;d give us a way to edit map, they did.... and more.<p>Game mechanics are hard so it makes sense to have a way for players to practice.<p>Every time me and my friends cheered, but we couldn&#x27;t see far ahead.<p>Game went from fun&#x2F;somewhat challenging&#x2F;social hangout time to toxic&#x2F;grifting type of place. Where only people who spent 5+ hours, not playing, practicing could even survive. To have fun in a game you need to be at least little good. But practice mode and full freedom in it made it so that the only way to have fun was to live a unfulfilling life overall as you&#x27;d be dedicating every walking hour on practice.<p>The whole culture within the game changed, before if you got challenged, you would accept it openly and fight and have good time, after &quot;improvements&quot; people would hide and sit in corners for 15 minutes at a time, only to die. Because now fighting meant you could run into someone who has been practicing 8+ hours daily and has no life.<p>In 1 year the difference between good and bad player became so wide they had to introduce tiered matching. It tracks how you are doing and if you keep doing better you are put into lobbies consisting of generally better players. This made even worst, if you do start to win, then you get placed with people who 100&#x2F;100 no-life practice mode habitants - the more you played the less fun it&#x27;d get.<p>A&#x2F;B testing would have always given a signal that things are getting better, up until a year later, when everything started to go down hill. i.e. Practice mode = engagement++++ week over week!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
