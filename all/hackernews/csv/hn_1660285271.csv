Hey everyone.
The rise of tik-tok and instagram,facebook and snapchat copying tik tok are everyday news.
Some context :

Well you have to do whatever it takes to make sure that users are occupied and they don&#x27;t leave you.<p>But the social media has become influencer media. Literally everyone is an influencer and playing the great online game. Now we know much more about the Kardashians than we know about our friends. And instead of talking to friends, we talk to strangers on Omegle (which is kind of fun). But we can&#x27;t make strong relationships with that.<p>How many of you have best friends whom you can trust blindly ( like Joey and Chandler ) ? Not many I guess. what started as a way to find friends and deepen the friendship faded with the lore of being an influencer.
And guess we are going in full circle here. Just like everything else.
There is a rise of dummy-phone , record sales of vinyl cassettes and cycles.<p>So I guess there will be a return to friendster and myspace. And we can kind of see that. With the rise of BeReal and Locket which tells you to share your true life with your friends. But it&#x27;s kind of boring tbh.<p>Instagram rose because of the filters which made everyone a &quot;good&quot; photographer. Tik-tok rose because it&#x27;s an entertainment cheetos. Short , crisp , interesting videos.<p>I downloaded BeReal, made my account and within an hour deleted it. It&#x27;s so boring. There is a feed where you can see the pics of everyone else where they&#x27;re being real. But why would I care about strangers if they&#x27;re binge watching stranger things or waiting in  a line. And those who are pro-users of it I think eventually they will be bored too. 
Locket app is a widget photo sharing app. You can capture photos and share with your friends which will appear on the homescreen widget.<p>But you might be wandering, well if you want entertainment you go to tik-tok . Well of course. BeReal and Locket are not for entertainment purposes but intimacy purpose.
But I guess these are tales of two extreme ends. And I see a middle path here.<p>My idea is basically to build something which strengthens the friendship of friends. Something you can reminisce nostalgically. Where you are closer with your near and dear ones and deepening the bond of your existing or new relationship. Where you know you have someone&#x27;s back to help you in rough times. Where friend is really a friend and not a facebook friend. Can discuss more about it if you are interested.<p>A little bit about me:
 I don&#x27;t have a track record of building great products. I don&#x27;t have a CS degree as I am a dropout. But what I am is a person who is really driven to make something valuable. My interest lies in this space. I love this space. And I am more of a idea person or  glue person. I am not pessimistic or optimistic about this. Fuck it. I am gonna get it done. 
I am looking for  folks who are driven and curious about this space and want to make a dent. Looking for a tech-cofounder(s) so that we can complement each other skills.
I want to have everyone to have at least one friend (just like Joey had Chandler). Consider joining me to execute this mission.<p>If you can help me in any way, by sharing this post, recommending someone  who might be interested in this idea, sharing your feedbacks, it will be highly appreciated.<p>Please contact me : amanvidyaviharian@gmail.com<p>Please avoid the grammatical errors.<p>Stay Hungry Stay Foolish",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
