Been working on a side project of mine for about a year called Gloutir. It&#x27;s essentially an &#x27;agency of one&#x27; design and development service using a subscription or retainer model for billing (Stripe + Memberstack).<p>I primarily focus on WordPress and Webflow design and development as I realized long ago that there&#x27;s a huge demand for these services  in the design &#x2F; marketing agency space.<p>I&#x27;ve had a lot of success the past year with this work, and surprisingly (or unsurprisingly) every single client of mine has been a larger agency needing additional help. That kind of makes sense because an agency can immediately see the value in what I offer without really having to be convinced.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve introduced a weekly option for clients looking to launch fast and spend less ($1,000 a week, maybe not sustainable but we’ll see). I&#x27;d love to get more involved with startups needing landing page work &#x2F; design services.<p>There are a number of people doing stuff like this, but I do want to clarify that this is never going to be an &quot;unlimited design&quot; style subscription service. I&#x27;ve intentionally set a hard cap on the number of clients because it&#x27;s simply impossible to accommodate more than a certain number of clients while keeping the quality of work where it needs to be.<p>Anywho, curious what you all think and if you have any suggestions on how to improve.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gloutir.com&#x2F;<p>About me: full time designer and developer at an agency.
