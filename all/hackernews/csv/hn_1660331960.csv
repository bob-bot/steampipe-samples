I&#x27;d like to make something similar but for some part of the real world.<p>The Pokédex from Pokémon is a familiar example but it&#x27;s not such a good one because Pokémon games mostly run on low-spec handhelds,  so I am thinking more about what you&#x27;d see on a PC or TV console games...  But instead of using a game controller you&#x27;d be using the touchscreen,  mouse or keyboard.<p>(3) However I very much like how games for the Nintendo DS&#x2F;3DS use the touchscreen such as peeling stickers in <i>Paper Mario Sticker Star</i> and how you can make Luigi fight in the boss battles in <i>Mario and Luigi Dream Team</i>.

• Digital Ocean Apps - Experimented with this. Was expensive and some limitations like ephemeral filesystem.
• Cloudways - Been pretty happy with this one. The control panel is a little clunky and you only get 1 DB per website, but its been pretty good for me. Support is hit or miss.
