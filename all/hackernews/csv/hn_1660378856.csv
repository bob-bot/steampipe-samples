32447836,Can anyone help me? Question on promoting a genuine app,2022-08-13T08:04:04Z,vitalipom,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi,
I have a genuine app I’ve been developing actively soon over a decade. It’s very genuine, indeed has new things to offer to the world. When I was offering it to people on the street they actually liked it. Now it is in a good shape. Like really looks as a hand crafted and appealing. Just to let you take a look at it to understand the quality you can google FKeyboard it’s on Android play market. It does have an innovative genuine thing (effects of letters pop out off the keyboard into the screen as you type) which is a first in the world user experience of its kind. BUT! I cannot talk to the tech guys that review those things. Like seriously, what’s wrong with me? Why I can’t convince anyone to review so that people would have get excided and it will run its way to everyone else? It did get a couple of news coverages. But each and every time time it was arghhhhhh like war. To get like just one news title. And others don’t even bother to reply? Why is it like that? Like I mean users from all over the world have been writing to me and we’ve became penpals and friends, we’ve been exchanging photos. I was answering to the kind ones and to the not kind ones. We’ve become friends with everyone (I and them). Then why is it so hard to reach the tech reviewers? 
Do they have lots of junk inside their mail boxes? Am I getting into the junk folders? Is it me who sounds like a robot in a review request? Is it the Android app thing that doesn’t sound legit once I’m emailing about? I literally put myself into every appeal I send, but it feels like I’m talking to void. Each and every time. Why? Why is that? Is it because I’m selling myself too much and I don’t know how to present myself in the emails? I really have things to say about myself and perhaps I sound like an automated sells person in my emails. What’s wrong with me? Please assist.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
