They’re usually crap, but all of them have in common that are all subscription based. Games are the biggest offenders, because they’re in-app purchase based. Every little interaction and progress requires paying for things. You end up with a child that is always asking for parents to enable some feature&#x2F;upgrade&#x2F;item that just showed up, only to find that it’s an IAP. These aren’t games, these are stores disguised as games.<p>When I bought my daughter an iPad, I spent about $200 buying full versions of apps and game, even yearly subscriptions so she’d have lots of entertainment, games, education without being nagged for more money. Less than a month later, none of that mattered. I refuse to be taken advantage of in this way, worse, by using my kids as ransom.
