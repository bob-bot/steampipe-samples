I foolishly  did not enable 2FA, kept a weak password. Wanted to know, if the hacker has my recovery code am I definitely f*ked ? because mega allows you to change your password using just your recovery codes and email id and the bad part is that the recovery code doesn&#x27;t change, its the same since the inception of the account. I feel so naked right now, I had a lot of private photos of me and my friends and lot of office documents. The hackers even put a delete my account options lmao. I am sure the password got leaked to a number of places because I checked the logs and they show that my account has been logged in from all over the globe(8 countries, started from Mexico). Like why the hell did mega not even give me a heads up&#x2F;email  about my account being logged in from all across the globe. Google does it when my account gets logged in from a new device. I feel so scared. I am planning on deleting my account altogether.<p>Any advice on how to proceed from here.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
