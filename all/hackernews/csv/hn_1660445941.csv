Tech stack for web scraping and simple frontend graphs,2022-08-14T02:04:28Z,Spinosaurus,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey all, starting to work on some of my own projects after a 5 year hiatus.<p>My personal projects in the past have often utilized a Node.js backend (Express) that served a React frontend, with a postgres db with Knex. I have a bit of familiarity with Rails.<p>I&#x27;m wondering how much things have changed in the past few years. I&#x27;m reading that React should probably be avoided, Vue seems popular, Svelte seems like the shiny new thing. I&#x27;m considering looking into Django as learning Python might be worthwhile.<p>My day job uses Kotlin, so Ktor or Spring seems like an option.<p>The project I&#x27;m building will basically scrape some data every day, store it in a database, and serve a front end primarily consisting of graphs. Is there a particular tech stack that is more suitable to that these days? Are there any stacks that should be <i>avoided</i> for such requirements? &quot;Overengineering&quot; is something I want to avoid.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
