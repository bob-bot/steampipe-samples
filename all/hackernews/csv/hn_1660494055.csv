I&#x27;m a senior dev who currently found himself working with C. On one hand I love it as it is familiar to me and I &quot;get&quot; it. OTOH I&#x27;m afraid it is regressing my future prospects as many consider it obsolete language and I&#x27;m in a market dominated by web dev and java enterprise.<p>So I&#x27;m thinking of investing in learning a more contemporary tech stack to stay relevant and employable. Doing mostly systems work (performance matters which is why we write in C) I was thinking maybe rust is a natural step for me but then again I worry that it won&#x27;t get much traction in companies (lots of pushback from devs and management invested in older stacks, learning curve, not time tested etc).<p>Anyway. The real question is how you decide where to invest your time&#x2F;energy next? I don&#x27;t know of any method to attack this problem other than let the circumstances choose for me.<p>Thanks",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
