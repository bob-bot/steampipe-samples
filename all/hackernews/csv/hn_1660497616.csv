32460814,Ask HN: Is there still an opportunity for an affordable CPanel alternative?,2022-08-14T16:59:08Z,obihill,2,false,false,1,[32460875],<null>,<null>,<null>,"&#x27;Asking because I&#x27;m considering building one.<p>I used to run a small Web hosting business and still manage a few client accounts. I moved these accounts [from a Web hosting reseller] to DigitalOcean about a year ago and installed CPanel because that&#x27;s what my clients are familiar with.<p>However, I&#x27;m paying more for the control panel license than for the actual servers; Cpanel makes up 60% of the total cost, and the server is 40%. This makes no economic sense to me. I guess I&#x27;ve been shielded from this because [before the transition] I used a hosting provider that required a flat monthly fee.<p>I&#x27;ve done some research on this and below are four (4) reasons why I see an opportunity:<p>1. The cheapest CPanel option is \$16 a month. The cheapest DigitalOcean droplet is \$4 a month; a gap that only a few users would tolerate. In addition, most of the negative feedback for CPanel on G2 and Capterra seems to be focused on pricing.
2. The minimum installation requirements for CPanel are 1Gb RAM and 20Gb HDD; recommended are 4Gb RAM and 40Gb HDD. So it&#x27;s not going to play nicely on entry-level, affordable cloud servers e.g. 512K RAM and 10Gb HDD. 
3. The UI&#x2F;UX could be so much better than it currently is, especially for mobile and keyboard users. My apologies for not being more specific on account of time; if you have used CPanel you should have an intuitive sense of what I mean. To be fair, it has improved significantly over the years.
4. There&#x27;s an API and CLI, but it doesn&#x27;t appear to be a workable alternative to the GUI. From the docs, it seems like you have to use the CLI after you login to the server via SSH. The same goes for the API when using PHP&#x2F;Perl; the module to include in your API call script resides on the server. It all seems a tad unwieldy in this day and age.<p>All the tools I&#x27;m considering for building this are mature, free and open-source (React, Node.js, etc.). My timeline estimate is 7 to 10 months. My objective is not to build a CPanel clone; it&#x27;s to build a free to affordable GUI for cloud servers with a developer-friendly API and CLI.<p>It seems like a good opportunity, but I&#x27;m biased. Ergo, I&#x27;d like to get some perspective.<p>What say you?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
