It went really well. I&#x27;d like to take the gig, but I&#x27;m choking on the idea of working with a staffing agency.<p>I have had my own business since 1996, and I&#x27;ve been contracting with individual clients ever since. It&#x27;s a been a good business.<p>I see working with a staffing agency (I&#x27;d be corp-to-corp) with them as introducing a third party into the relationship, and that they would be basically rent-seeking off of the relationship over the longer haul.<p>I think this gig could be 5 years or so of good, interesting work at a reasonable rate.<p>At the same time, I want to be objective as I can be in my thinking about this. I&#x27;m having trouble seeing any benefit from having them in the loop for the long term.<p>Are their any good arguments for working with a staffing agency on a gig that would last more than a year?<p>As you likely know, the staffing agency makes it contractually difficult, if not outright impossible, to cut them out and for me to work directly with the client on a corp-to-corp basis.<p>I would be willing to put up with the staffing agency for six months or a year. What I find hard to swallow is working with them in the loop for a longer period.<p>Thanks for any advice you can offer.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
