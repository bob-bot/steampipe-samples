32462742,Was Charlie Chaplain prosecuted for being raped at gunpoint?,2022-08-14T20:39:51Z,danfickle,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Charlie Chaplin lost a paternity trial where the mother was Joan Barry (an alias), despite blood group tests excluding Chaplin as father. He was charged with several criminal charges relating to Barry. According to the 1946 appeal (also lost):<p>“She testified that she and defendant had four acts of sexual intercourse at or about the date when, in the ordinary course of nature, the child must have been begotten. These acts occurred on the 10th, 23rd, 24th and 30th days of December, 1942.” [1]<p>—-<p>Apparently not examined at trial was December 19th 1942, when according to Chaplin’s FBI file[2] (part 02, page 166), Barry also told the FBI she had an “affair”. At the time, Chaplin’s children Sydney &amp; Charles Jr were 13 and 14.<p>According to the record of Barry’s interview, she says the affair with Chaplin turned sexual after signing a contract with his studio on June 1 1941. Not recounted is how the pair originally met. Very little is known about her life pre-1941 and less post 1953.<p>Paulette was his long term partner. Wikipedia reveals she was granted a Mexican divorce in June 1942[3]. The marriage was apparently never official, so it is unclear why she travelled for a legal procedure. Later she would move to Switzerland, nearby to where Chaplin was living after being banned from America.<p>Edward was Chaplin’s butler.<p>Barry’s abridged account of December 19 from the FBI file follows. The reader is invited to peruse the actual file to check whether my editing is reasonable.<p>I then bought another gun at the Hollywood Gun Shop, just a day or so before I went up to Chaplin’s on this date which I believe to be about December 19.
…
I finally resolved to see Charles, thinking that when I got up there I would kill myself right in front of him.
…
I went around in back and knocked on the door and when nobody came, I broke the glass and went in.
…
When I got upstairs he was on the telephone talking to someone in affectionate tones.  I listened for five minutes or so to him from the dressing room and became jealous and took the gun out of my pocket and pointed it at him as I came into the room.
…
Then we sat on the bed together and Charles took hold of my hand in which I was holding the gun and told me not to be foolish. He told me that I should stay all night
…
However, Charles’ two boys, Charles jr. and Sidney were out in the hall.
…
From what Edward has since told me of the conversation that night between him and Charles, Edward apparently asked him if everything  was all right and Charles told him he could handle the situation. … the boys also asked him at the same time and he told them to go on back to bed. Charles then came back into the room and locked both doors into the hall and another door which led to the bathroom, which connects Paulette’s bedroom with Charles&#x27;. We then had an affair, during which time the gun was on the night stand between the two beds where I could reach it with my right hand.
…
Afterwards we both tried to go to sleep and I found his snoring irritating and I called him and told him I was going into the next room. I took the gun with me, though he said &quot;leave it with me” and I said no. It was probably around 4:00AM that I went into Paulette’s room, but I did not get to sleep until around 6:00. Charles came in a couple of times and tried to get the gun from me, but I did not give it to him.
…
The next morning Charles came into my room and wanted to have another affair. I told him no. Edward later told me that he had heard CHAPLIN say that. It was probably 11:00 that morning that I got up. Edward came up that morning and tried to talk me into  giving him the gun and said that Charlie had sent him there for that purpose. Later Charles came up and I gave him the gun, along with the bill of sale.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.justia.com&#x2F;cases&#x2F;california&#x2F;court-of-appeal&#x2F;2d&#x2F;74&#x2F;652.html
