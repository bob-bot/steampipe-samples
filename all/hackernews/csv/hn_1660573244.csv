Or so I thought.<p>The day before yesterday I noticed a recent charge from Amazon. Upon calling Amazon, it appears that it was for the Prime subscription of another Amazon account, not mine. I put it very plainly that this charge was unauthorized, and that I do not want anyone else using my credit card with their Amazon account. To my surprise, they told me that they couldn&#x27;t remove my credit card from another person&#x27;s Amazon account as a form of payment. All they could do was refund the amount to me. I asked if that party would be able to continue to charge purchases to my credit card, and the customer service representative said yes. And there was nothing they could do about it.<p>Amazon, being a big company, I&#x27;m sure they somehow update credit card information from the credit card companies themselves. Thus, they were able to get the new number for my card after I cancelled the old one, and I assume they surreptitiously linked it to every account which had my old credit card linked.<p>I contacted Discover again and they&#x27;re investigating it.
