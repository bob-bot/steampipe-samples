How to negotiate a salary for less pay, to min wage?",2022-08-16T06:56:33Z,ditherblur,1,false,false,2,[32480028],<null>,<null>,<null>,"This probably sounds stupid; let me explain.<p>I live in NJ near NYC. A quick google search tells me that the average SWE salary in NYC is around $132k. Looking at the current &quot;Who is hiring&quot; thread, at a glance, it seems that most salaries range from $75k to $250k+ from just the few that list them.<p>I want to work these same jobs at minimum wage, meaning around $27k.<p>Why? Because I want things to be &quot;calmer.&quot;<p>I want to know that I&#x27;ll have an easier time applying and getting hired faster than other applicants at my same skill level because I&#x27;m willing to work for much less than expected.<p>I want to know that I&#x27;ll be less likely to be let go during downsizing because I work at less pay than others at the same level. I want to know that I&#x27;m more valued at a company because the cost to keep me around is so low that if they have a bad quarter, they think of me last to get rid of.<p>I want management to know that I will not jump ship as soon as someone else offers me higher pay; I love stability and consistency. By asking for lesser pay, I don&#x27;t want to communicate that I&#x27;m going to slack off but that I want to work at a lower salary in exchange for work to be &quot;calmer,&quot; like being able to afford to work my own pace just a little bit. And by working at my own pace,  I&#x27;m not trying to phrase getting distracted playing games on the job as working at my pace but that I&#x27;m taking some more time to read, take notes, and planning things out more to make the process &quot;calmer.&quot;<p>I know a lot of people who work at a high salary (for example, say $90k, to me already a lot of money, but I know it&#x27;s not enough to some), who spend most of the day doing &quot;nothing.&quot; Like getting a mouse jiggler to simulate that they&#x27;re at meetings. Or they spend most of the time watching shows or playing games while doing the occasional ticket (but are the most likely to be let go when the company has a bad quarter or during a recession).<p>If I&#x27;m willing to work the same way and things are &quot;calm&quot; enough, why not just go for the extra money? Because I want the guarantees of everything to be &quot;calmer,&quot; and I&#x27;m more than happy to forgo any extra pay for more &quot;calmness.&quot;<p>At the onset of applying, I never had the opportunity to phrase this as a competitive advantage, so I&#x27;m competing as if I want that higher pay, but I don&#x27;t.<p>I love the structure and feel of these jobs (I don&#x27;t want to freelance or anything similar). How can I convey these feelings without causing people to think I&#x27;m being silly? Or to even suggest this without causing hiring to think I&#x27;m unqualified&#x2F;have imposter syndrome or whatever?<p>I&#x27;m writing this at 3 am and trying to brainstorm better ways to express myself than a weird-sounding email that will probably get ignored saying, &quot;hey, that job you posted, I&#x27;ll do it for min wage.&quot;",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
