I&#x27;ve been a software engineer for about a decade with experience across the .NET stack, JS, Angular, React, SQL &#x2F; NoSQL databases, the works!<p>I recently got three professional level Azure Certs too. I&#x27;ve been unemployed for a while now due to personal circumstances and have been trying to get into the job market recently and I&#x27;ve run into problems I do not know how to handle.<p>1) The Pay structure is based on either what you&#x27;ve already been paid at your previous employer (which is mostly underpaid) or tied to years of Experience(Glass ceiling on how much you make)<p>2) The places where you do get slightly paid more have leetcode style interviews and too many applications and always nodejs &#x2F; react typical web dev jobs.<p>3) I do not wanna relocate from my suburban neighborhood to a metropolitan city at all. The pollution, commute, congestion etc., have taken a toll on me.<p>4) The remote jobs here are turning into Hybrid and it is hard to find truly remote jobs anymore.<p>5) I&#x27;d like to find a truly international remote job but most listings say Remote(US only &#x2F; Europe Only) or something similar.<p>6) I am not an expert in any one single tech i.e I&#x27;m the guy that gets the job done and have to wear many hats based on what the situation calls for.<p>How do I go about finding these internationally remote jobs? How do I prepare for these interviews? Where do I even start? I&#x27;m so confused and lost and my savings are running out.
