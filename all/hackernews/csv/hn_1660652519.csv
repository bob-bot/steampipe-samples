Even on consumer chips vector instructions take up a noticeable amount of die space [1].<p>Throughput over latency. The problem is embarrassingly parallel and can be divided to suit any number of cores.  Cores could be register or stack machines. Cores need to have access to &gt;100 MB.

The workload is branch rich so SIMD&#x2F;SIMT is not possible. The workload is mostly integer instructions.
