32486011,Launch HN: Viventum – Web3 ticketing compatible with legacy systems,2022-08-16T17:29:53Z,Coreezee,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN, Cristian and Tudor here, co-founders of Viventum (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;viventum.xyz"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;viventum.xyz</a>). We&#x27;re a team of 3: 2 engineers - Tudor is leading a team of students at Siemens, me (Cristian) am the co-author of a paper published at MIT &amp; a sales mastermind, Alex, who is a student at TU Munich.<p>We build a Web3 API based ticketing solution which can be integrated with legacy systems. The core of our product is Web3, and we put some sweet Web2 layers on top to make it user friendly.<p>To crack the ticketing market we build our solution to 1) be better at fulfilling the market needs than what is currently available, 2) solving the problems of fraud, scalping, lack of market control &amp; insights and 3) make using the blockchain frictionless. All these lead to having an at least 10x better product.<p>To better understand our approach, here is a quick overview of the ticketing market: ticketing is very similar with the airline industry - there are two sides 1) airplane builders (e.g. Boeing, Airbus) and 2) airlines (hundreds of them). Current implementations mainly want to build the plane and be the airline at the same time. You can already foresee the problems. Ticketing is a fragmented industry lacking an interoperable standard that can both satisfy the current needs and solve the problems of fraud, scalping and overall lack of control. Because such a standard has not been built yet, the market had to prioritize - it logically picked the flawed, but working, current implementations.<p>We&#x27;re building Ticketing 3.0 and our thesis has two parts:
1) Technology can finally provide a solution that satisfies the current needs &amp; solves the decades old problems.
2) Primary ticket sellers (aka airlines) have a tough enough of a job already - they need to take care of organizers, promoters, artists, venues, fans and many others. If we add to this list also taking care of the tech, we end up with the mess of a market from today. It makes no sense for them to also do the tech - this adds a lot of complexity and a heap of additional problems.<p>BUT, if we remove the burden of tech from ticket sellers, everything works perfectly. Primary ticket sellers can focus on consumer satisfaction and tech providers (Viventum, aka the airplane builders) can focus on making the tech secure.<p>Our USP is focused on the following points:
1) We have a tech-first approach. We want to unify and dominate the ticketing industry. For this to be possible, we need to make a product able to bridge all the hundreds of venues &amp; ticket sellers worldwide.
2) We bring Web3 to ticketing, and not the other way around. 90% of the western population attends some kind of ticketed event. MetaMask has around 5 million users worldwide. This is means that from the 2B+ people attending events, almost nobody has a crypto wallet.
3) This point is connected with the second one: we build for a seamless user journey, where our stakeholders will only reap the rewards and have to deal with the complications of using the latest tech.
4) Right now the words of PG come into mind &quot;build things that don&#x27;t scale&quot;. We stay true to those words, building our own marketplace to be our own first customer and integrate the APIs, focusing on getting fast feedback from the market.<p>We started Viventum a few months ago, two engineers excited to use the latest tech, and now we are three co-founders. We continue to improve our product and to better position it in the market by continuously getting feedback from our early customers. If you&#x27;d like to be part of our product feedback and iteration process, we&#x27;d love to have you onboard - get in touch at contact@viventum.xyz.<p>Tudor and I are excited build our solution which fully integrates Web3 and Web2 at the same time. We&#x27;d love to hear your ideas, experiences, and suggestions. Check out our current product at www.viventum.xyz. If you&#x27;re fans, what do you think of the current product? If you are vendors or organizers, what are you&#x27;re pain points?",story,https://www.viventum.xyz/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
