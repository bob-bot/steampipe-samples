32489019,Does Google Overcache Their DNS for Email?,2022-08-16T21:13:00Z,mxuribe,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I recently moved away from GSuite (to a paid email proviuder), and while my new provider is working great...I am seeing the odd email or 2 slip back into the Google inbox side. All DNS (MX, SPF, etc.) had been updated to point to my new provider...and yet, every once in a while maybe once per 2 weeks, I see an email message show up in the google inbox.  Thankfully, it is not an important email message; they all have tended to be marketing emails.  But, has anyone else experienced this?  My theory is one of the following: 1) One of Google&#x27;s servers is stuck with old DNS info and still routing some emails to themselves&#x2F;Google. 2) Or, some other DNS server out there is stuck sending messages towards Google...and Google is happy to receive them.<p>I still have access to the google account associated with the legacy GSuite, but it simply doesn&#x27;t send (so that part at least works fine) - which is why i was able to discover this little bug. Am I the only one experiencing this?  I&#x27;m trying to give Google the benefit of the doubt, and assume this is simply a bug, andf not some greater conspiracy...but would love to hear if anyone - especially those who moved away from GSuite - is seeing this too.

But theoretically they should be getting the best prices, because they are paying without the expenses and delays of insurance claims. However, insurance contracts are written in a way that prevents anyone outside a network from getting better prices than insurers.<p>The Pocketero solution: An affordable non-insurance network for people who pay out of pocket for healthcare, especially those who can&#x27;t afford health insurance. Network members get the best prices from network providers.<p>If you have any comments about the design, implementation, business model, etc. - please share your thoughts!",story,https://www.pocketero.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
