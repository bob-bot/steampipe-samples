This is something I have observed with companies which push for back-to-office rules.<p>1) exec announces back-to-office, either 100% or demanding minimum presence. They do this describing how much they look forward to finally reunite again.<p>2) A subjectively large proportion of employees tend to dislike the change since they seem to enjoy the flexibility associated with wfh.<p>3) A debate begins between two seemingly absolute opposite positions: those who justify 100% remote and those demanding 100% presence.<p>4) Some kind of compromise is either made or introduced from the start where execs don‘t demand 100% office presence, but at least some.<p>Now what I wonder is why all of these debates tend to lean towards the absolutes, totally neglecting what, subjectively, most „pro remote“ employees would really desire: having the freedom to plan their on-site presence independently based on what they and their teams actually need. Execs usually seem to imply meeting in person would not be possible without their minimum presence push, sometimes relying solely on this point to justify it, while teams I spoke to usually do want to schedule regular presence meetings, recurring workshops, both internally as well as together with other teams. None of the employees of various companies I spoke to actually demand 100% remote, instead they seem to desire more trust by their execs to manage their presence as they see fit.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

There is just enough desperation, social unrest, government corruption, and resource depletion to trigger survival instincts on the largest scale.<p>Just like individuals have a drive for self-preservation, nations do too. Wars happen when two or nation&#x27;s drive for self-preservation collide. It seems Russia, China, and North Korea have already aligned while the US&#x2F;EU have aligned, not sure where India stands. The US has warships moving in the South China Sea, China sees that as an act of escalation. Winter is coming in the EU with Russia withholding energy. TikTok is spying on the all it&#x27;s users and Russia interfered in US elections...<p>I&#x27;m just curious to hear what others think&#x2F;feel.
