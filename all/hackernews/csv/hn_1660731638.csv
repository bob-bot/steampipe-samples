- it has no &#x27;mission statement&#x27; or explanation
- it manages to come in near the top of search results
- almost nobody ever talks about it
- it has old builds that the official site doesn&#x27;t have anymore
- I download the nexus 5 zip and checked it with https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LineageOS&#x2F;update_verifier and it checks
(I hope that means it was just copied from straight from the old site, and that I am safe to use it for an experiment, and it it is no more unsafe than any other old android phone)
- they have been banned from twitter https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lineageosroms
- there are no ads
- almost nobody is talking about this. one person says &quot;no not legit&quot; and somebody else says &quot;scammers like lineageosroms.com&quot;
- they care enough to put this at the bottom &quot;Content of this page is based on informations from github and LineageOS Wiki, under CC BY-SA 3.0 licence.&quot;
- nothing useful in whois<p>I&#x27;m having trouble connecting all the dots.  I would have asked on lineageos subreddit except they have this rule:
&gt; Don&#x27;t link to or discuss unofficial builds or sites.  Please don&#x27;t post links to unofficial builds or unofficial news sources. If it&#x27;s not lineageos.org -- it&#x27;s not official.<p>So here is the best I can do:
- it&#x27;s a scam that inserts malware into zips, just not the rom I checked
- I didn&#x27;t check the zip well enough
- It&#x27;s a well meaning person that put it all the work for their idea, but never got around to telling anybody about it or explaining it, and is now gets dismissed as a scammer
- It&#x27;s a proposed redesign and&#x2F;or part of some internal lineageos dispute
- It&#x27;s the same as all the other copy pasted content search result spam on the internet, except they forgot to put the banners in
- It&#x27;s doing stuff to my browser that I don&#x27;t know about when I visit the site<p>Any idea?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
