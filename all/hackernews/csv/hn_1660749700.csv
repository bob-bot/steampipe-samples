32496909,"Ask HN: 91-year-old's Hotmail account hacked, only automated support responses",2022-08-17T14:29:45Z,frereubu,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"My elderly mother has been locked out of an old Hotmail account that I wasn&#x27;t aware existed and I&#x27;m finding it impossible to figure out how to get access back, continually hitting automated brick walls without even some kind of live chat. I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s going to be used for identity theft. Timeline (UK):<p>August 15th afternoon - She gets a message to her iCloud email address (presumably used as a backup for the Hotmail account) saying &quot;Action required for two-step verification&quot;<p>August 16th lunchtime - Another message saying &quot;please use the following security code for the Microsoft account ab*c@hotmail.co.uk (where a, b and c are letters from her name).<p>August 16th a few minutes later - Message saying &quot;The following security info was recently deleted from the Microsoft account ab*c@hotmail.co.uk&quot; giving her iCloud email address.<p>She got in touch with me when she picked these messages up today - she&#x27;s been drilled by me to get in touch when something suspicious like this comes up, and is generally pretty sharp at spotting dubious emails - but because she doesn&#x27;t pick up her email address regularly it&#x27;s seemingly too late for the usual recovery method of backup email address.<p>What&#x27;s particularly concerning is that they seemingly managed to get access to the Hotmail account without access to the iCloud account - the first email was about 2FA being set up on the account, and the iCloud account hasn&#x27;t had the password changed or any security settings updated despite that being the backup account.<p>I&#x27;m trying to get access back for her, but all I&#x27;m getting is an account recovery process that, if you don&#x27;t get enough details right for the automated systems, just says &quot;At this point, your best option is to submit a new form with as much accurate information as you can gather.&quot; This email account is clearly hers, as it had her iCloud account as a backup contact method, but she&#x27;s not sure when or why she created it, so it&#x27;s difficult to answer questions like &quot;give us some email addresses that you emailed recently&quot; or &quot;give us some exact subject lines of recent emails.&quot;<p>Does anyone here have any experience of this where they&#x27;ve managed to get through to a human being at Microsoft who can actually help? I understand it&#x27;s difficult because the email address is old and she&#x27;s not sure what&#x27;s in it, but the fact that someone seems to have targeted it is giving me the heebie-jeebies.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
