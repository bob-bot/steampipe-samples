Often times in USA it’s just a regular old sql database of some type storing the results on top a regular Linux&#x2F;Windows computer. I think it’s obviously a huge scandal that “electronic voting machines” have been normalized in public consciousness. Whenever I tell people it’s ridiculous that electronic machines have taken over the paper ballot box im called crazy or paranoid. Wake up people! Electronic voting machines are a scam used to undermine your democracies.
The only way to fix the problem and restore faith in humanity is to scrap all electronic voting machines and go back to paper. (Or, how about an extremely simple electronic circuit, 2 buttons, printed in copper suspended in acrylic so anyone in the room can verify with their own eyes the circuit isn’t tampered with, as long as they can understand simple circuits. these circuits will be directly connected to a tabulator machine similarly implemented as a simple circuit located in a public room, suspended within acrylic, and with a visible copper connection to the voting booths, which would have extremely thin opaque walls for privacy but also ensuring that you can see it’s not being siphoned off. The open hardware folks can create the simplest most effective circuit that’s still easily be auditable by the human eye. )",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
