32503051,"Ask HN: Sold a 1K item on eBay; chargeback occurred–eBay collections, now what?",2022-08-17T23:17:21Z,nikkwong,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I sold a MakerBot printer on ebay for $1,000. The printer was used, but was in almost new condition and worked flawlessly. I indicated it&#x27;s condition as used. When the buyer received it, he instantly started sending me incendiary messages about how he was expecting a new printer (I didn&#x27;t give him the original box, or things like that). The messages were borderline harassment with lots of expletives. For some context, this was one of the messages: &quot;Bi*h I paid over 1k for this new not a used one. U fake a* broke little bi*h what a broke a* bi*h ur a f**g joke&quot;.<p>I politely let the buyer know he could return it, but didn&#x27;t hear anything else from him. A few weeks later, I learned that he issued a chargeback with his CC company. I submitted evidence, including a screenshot of the original posting, as well as the messages, and my request for him to send the item back. I learned a week ago that the CC company approved the chargeback; and now eBay is telling me I owe them $1,000 or it will go to collections.<p>I feel like I&#x27;ve been scammed and I&#x27;ve lost my printer. I wonder if anyone has any advice for remedying this situation. I&#x27;ve read that I could go to arbitration over the chargeback, but I don&#x27;t know if that will work with ebay&#x27;s ecosystem and it seems like a pain.<p>Thanks for any advice.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
