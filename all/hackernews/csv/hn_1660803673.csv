32505810,Show HN: StoneDB—A Real-Time HTAP Database Based on the MySQL Kernel,2022-08-18T05:56:04Z,Bright_Li,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"StoneDB is an open-source hybrid transaction&#x2F;analytical processing (HTAP) database designed and developed by StoneAtom based on the MySQL kernel. It is the first database of this type launched in China. StoneDB can be seamlessly switched from MySQL. It provides features such as optimal performance and real-time analytics, offering you a one-stop solution to process online transaction processing (OLTP), online analytical processing (OLAP), and HTAP workloads.<p>StoneDB is fully compatible with the MySQL 5.6 and 5.7 protocols, the MySQL ecosystem, and common MySQL features and syntaxes. Tools and clients in the MySQL ecosystem, such as Navicat, Workbench, mysqldump, and mydumper, can be directly used on StoneDB. In addition, all workloads on StoneDB can be run on MySQL.<p>StoneDB is optimized for OLAP applications. StoneDB that runs on a common server can process complex queries on tens of billions of data records, while ensuring high performance. Compared to databases that use MySQL Community Edition, StoneDB is at least 10 times faster in processing queries.<p>StoneDB uses the Knowledge Grid technology and a column-based storage engine. The column-based storage engine is designed for OLAP applications and uses techniques such as column-based storage, Knowledge Grid-based filtering, and high-efficiency data compression. With such storage engine, StoneDB ensures the high performance of application systems and reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO).",story,https://github.com/stoneatom/stonedb,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
