I was poking around and realise that the blog points towards resources from the font&#x27;s author website and I noticed a reference in the html to a supposedly full version of the font.<p>It turned out to be the full version and I reported this to the creator. He then asked what I wanted as a reward and I indicated that it would be nice if I could get a copy  of the font.<p>The author then gave me a license for a very limited version of the font he was selling and indicated that he could not afford to give me the full set.<p>At this point I am a bit amused and puzzled. I have just saved this author many potential lost sales of the full set of fonts because the link wasn&#x27;t all that hard to find and yet it is too costly to gift me a full set? Is this kind of mindset prevalent or is my expectations not compatible with reality?<p>Is there some angle of thinking about this that makes sense? At this point to me it is not so much about the cots or the reward. I am just curious what drives such behaviour.,story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
