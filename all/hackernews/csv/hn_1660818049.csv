I&#x27;m a UG university student, and I&#x27;m building an email service built on the Solana blockchain.<p>Companies like Google have way too much control over email. They get to decide whether or not mail hits your inbox. I&#x27;ve had incidents in the past where Gmail silently <i>blocked</i> my emails because their AI thought they were malicious.<p>You may say &quot;use your own mail server&quot;, but that is easier said than done; the average user has neither time nor skill. Besides, if your contacts are using Gmail, good luck getting past their spam filter on a shared IP.<p>On the more philosophical side, services like Gmail and Outlook give the illusion that their services are free to use, which leads to over-consumption and over-reliance. At the end of the day somebody has to pay the bills - why not let the user pay for what they use instead of absorbing that cost and selling their data?<p>--<p>On the technical side of things, it uses decentralized technologies like IPFS to store your emails. There is absolutely no centralized server involved (unless you consider our web host, Netlify) and you will soon be able to run the webapp locally.<p>What about encryption, you say? We currently encrypt all email content, including subject and attachments using x25519-xsalsa20-poly1305, via the libsodium box API. Before the stable release we will switch to a post-quantum encryption scheme such as NTRU.<p>Thanks for reading till the end!<p>PS: The service is hosted at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stenzor.com",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I suspect it isn&#x27;t entirely in the spirit of typical HN discussion. It&#x27;s just that I cannot find the solution elsewhere online despite my best efforts.

On Ubuntu (20.04), you can use gnome-tweaks to disable the middle-click-to-paste feature. Once disabled here, it is applied to all gnome apps and assorted programs (for example the text editor, terminal, etc.).<p>However for some reason the middle-click-paste persists inside of Chrome. This is extremely frustrating because I am one of those users that likes to hold down middle-click to scroll (which is particularly ergonomic on my ThinkPad - fellow ThinkPad users will understand).<p>What&#x27;s happening now however is that whenever I scroll in Chrome whilst typing an email or filling in forms it just randomly pastes whatever is in my clipboard. Aside from being annoying, I&#x27;ve on occasion also accidentally submitted &#x2F; sent erroneously pasted text.<p>How on earth can I disable middle-click-paste in Chrome without disabling middle-click altogether?<p>Is there some kind of Chrome setting or flag or extension?<p>Help me HNers; you&#x27;re my only hope.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
