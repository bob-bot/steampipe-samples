32509622,Ask HN: Online maths courses that teach the why?,2022-08-18T13:54:39Z,tempaskacc,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Long story short - Are there any maths courses that teach <i>why</i> things work, instead of ways to move numbers around in notation?<p>Hello, I&#x27;m 16, in the UK. I&#x27;ve always struggled with maths in school despite enjoying it in other areas (when programming, and in videos by ThreeBlueOneBrown etc). Exams tend to be alright because I can problem solve, but I&#x27;ve never found it easy.<p>My 10 year old sister&#x27;s been having a similar experience learning fractions. I sat down to help her with some homework and quickly discovered that instead of teaching her what a fraction <i>is</i>, she&#x27;s learnt a series of heuristics that get the right answer for a given question while not understanding what she&#x27;s actually doing. I started to teach her what fractions actually are - to the level of &quot;Fractions are parts of something&quot;, &quot;1&#x2F;2 means one half of a whole&quot;, &quot;the bottom number means how many parts the whole has been broken into, the top number how many of those parts you have&quot; - etc. It finally clicked for her, so we decided to go over her assumptions regarding decimals as well: Again, they&#x27;d taught her &quot;zero dot twenty-five means one over four&quot;, instead of what they actually were. 20 minutes of explaining place value later, she&#x27;s gotten that too. By teaching her what things actually are, I&#x27;ve gotten her past months of falling behind a class as she struggled to learn the heuristics. I&#x27;m not a particularly good teacher - it&#x27;s just the way it&#x27;s been explained to her that caused issues.<p>That experience prompted me to think about my maths education, and I&#x27;ve had the same issues - e.g. I&#x27;ve learnt several rules for <i>computing</i> trigonometry, but I have no idea what sin, cos, and tan really are. This post is getting long so I won&#x27;t go into more details, but I think I would benefit from resources that teach mathematics that way - teaching what things are, not just how to manipulate them through tricks. I&#x27;m starting maths and further maths A levels in a few weeks. I&#x27;ve looked at resources like ThreeBlueOneBrown, and while the quality of the content is incredible, he doesn&#x27;t cover anywhere near the breadth of content I&#x27;ll be doing[1]. I would really appreciate recommendations for more content like it, that explains secondary (high) school mathematics using the why.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filestore.aqa.org.uk&#x2F;resources&#x2F;mathematics&#x2F;specifications&#x2F;AQA-7357-SP-2017.PDF",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It feels to me that the transformative era of tech is over, and we are now in &quot;maintenance mode,&quot; for lack of a better term. The &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s revolutionized computing, and the web matured into a real platform during the &#x27;00s and &#x27;10s. The big players grew from one- or two-person projects in literal or proverbial garages into firmly established global juggernauts. (In some cases this began in the &#x27;70s.) Whole industries—publishing, entertainment, transportation, retail, communication—were fundamentally changed, and whole new ways of connecting people were developed. New ideas and technologies were sprouting up everywhere, and they were exciting and solved obvious problems. It wasn&#x27;t all roses of course, and there&#x27;s much discussion to be had on the externalities, but it was undeniably revolutionary.<p>Now it seems, to me at least, that the party is more or less over. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else feels this way or if I&#x27;ve simply become jaded and cynical. (I am prone to jadedness and cynicism so this is entirely possible.) Things like &quot;the metaverse&quot; and the bizarrely-named &quot;web3&quot; feel like desperate attempts to keep finding the next big thing in a field that has simply run out of big things to find. I can&#x27;t identify a single small company working on something that feels like it&#x27;ll be huge—the next Google, Netflix, or what have you.
