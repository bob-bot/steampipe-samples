32512618,Ask HN: How do you operationalize life-advice books you read into your own life?,2022-08-18T17:36:34Z,dv35z,4,false,false,2,"[32512811,32512792]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN gang-<p>I’ve been reading books lately on improving life (e.g. Atomic Habits, the Artists Way), and what I’m finding is that these books offer so much great “do X action every Y time interval &#x2F; trigger ” advice -and while reading it, I think “wow yes, I definitely ought to do that”. But… Naturally, time passes and if I’m not deliberate about thinking of those great ideas, I tend to forget about them. I had this idea of using a knowledge base tool (eg Notion, but preferably an open source tool like Hugo) to take notes on the book, and to break out all the “do this” into useful checklists for the day. I’ve found that a good (printed!) checklist can boot up a new habit quickly, and in about 2 months, it feels naturally integrated into your life. With some of these business&#x2F;life advice books - I want to open Linear.app and start making a backlog of stuff to do, hire a product manager from Upwork and have them work with me on actually DOING all these high value activities. Haven’t done that yet, but it feels like it could be effective. Team work makes the dream work, accountability partner, and all that. Back to the books.<p>I would love to approach any new book with Intention &amp; a System (I recall there was a post on HN on “How to read X books at once”, where the author had a great system on how to systematically “extract” knowledge from many books at once, perhaps someone can find it). Usually, when I read a book, I’m take notes, in the margin, etc. But where does that really Go? I’d much prefer to add all the “to-dos” to a document,  group by recommended interval, and get them on a calendar, along with an easy checklist. Ideally, I’d then review my day - nicely formatted into a presidential-briefing-ish “one pager” - it would list off all the important “to-dos” which apply to the day. I can feel confident that the good advice I’m reading is actively being main-lined into my life, should I choose to perform those actions. Analogous to doing a weekly retrospective, making changes, and then adding those “action items” to the team backlog for continuous improvement.<p>I’d love to hear from others who have been down this route, built something like this for their own life.<p>Thank you.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
