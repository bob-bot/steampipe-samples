32516418,Show HN: I built an app to save time planning your Google calendar using AI,2022-08-19T00:27:48Z,rish1_2,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN,<p>I built a mobile app to help you save time planning your google calendar using AI. One of the biggest problems with tasks and meetings is that they are not fluid and they don’t change with your day. Spending X amount of time to rearrange your calendar defeats the purpose. So how do you keep you calendar sync with your day? This impacts your true availability too.<p>I realized that 80% of our work is similar so how do I capture that information to help with scheduling? Simple, tags and semantic search. Your past tasks and meetings become templates for your new ones when the scheduler works. Atomic does heavy pre-processing before sending your events to the AI schedule solver. There are many attributes to the event and more info is the landing page. Two big ones are time preferences (time boundaries for your events) and priorities. With these two alone your new schedule should reflect your day. These attributes get copied over when you run the scheduler.<p>So let’s say you have a meeting with John Doe and John only prefers certain times of the week. You add that information into the event. Next time you have a meeting with John, the scheduler will take the time preferences in to account.<p>Tasks get a big boost because now you can sync them and let the scheduler place them at the right place. All you have to do is tap a button and choose a range for the scheduler to work on.<p>Tags work in a similar manner. There is automatic tagging but you can copy over them from a previous template as well. Tags have their own settings including time preferences and event attribute copying settings.<p>I am seeking beta testers before a full launch and fix any critical bugs.<p>FYI - there is a playground for the semantic search and smart tagging function on the landing page. Please check it out!<p>Known limits<p>1. Google calendar has limits on number of events you can update at a time.
2. You have to set your work schedule under settings of the app or the schedule assist won’t work. Make it wide to cover your whole week.<p>product hunt link: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;atomic-3"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;atomic-3</a>",story,https://www.atomiclife.app/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
