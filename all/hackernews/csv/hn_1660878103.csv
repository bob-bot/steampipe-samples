They are tiny CDN served apps<p>2. They exclusively rely on localStorage<p>I&#x27;ve sent them to friends via chat and we had fun but they don&#x27;t understand why they lose the progress&#x2F;state when we stop chatting and they open Safari and Chrome but then get it back again when we chat. Not only it is difficult to make people open the browser manually but actually explaining what an in-app browser is... it&#x27;s almost impossible.<p>Have you encountered something similar? Personally I don&#x27;t hate the extra targeting or in-app time the social giants make from in-app browsers. It&#x27;s the complete fragmented mess of web sessions across apps and the difficulty of explaining it to non-tech people that makes my blood boil.,story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
