32517631,The cold start problem of a new identity on social media,2022-08-19T04:46:19Z,punkpeye,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I have my main social accounts that I started over a decade ago. I don&#x27;t even remember how I started or how I got my first followers, but I don&#x27;t remember it being a challenge. I am pretty sure I just shared whatever came to my mind and what I thought is useful for others, and one by one, I gathered thousands of followers. Past 10k, if you post something even remotely interesting, you are almost guaranteed to get enough engagement to attract even more followers, and so it goes.<p>Punkpeye (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;punkpeye) is an experiment – can I build a new identity from the ground up in a new niche?<p>I just spent the first day trying to build audience on Twitter. I figured that since now I have 0 followers, I need to curate a list of high-relevance Twitter users and DM them something useful. The goal is to do something together that would allow me to leverage their audience, e.g. write a thread together. I spent a few hours doing it. I got a handful of responses and even a few followers. At least 1 thread will come out of this and hopefully will kick off the growth cycle.<p>However, not long after I started my first dozen conversations, I got a message from Twitter saying that my messages were being blocked because of suspicious activity. Hopefully, that is a temporary measure until someone manually checks my conversations. Long story short, starting a new social identity is hard because platforms like Twitter effectively penalize you for going above and beyond to build an audience.<p>It is an interesting experience. I&#x27;ve advised others who are just starting to build their audience many times before. However, I am learning that advice from a decade is not directly transferable to the current times. Growing your audience, especially the first handful of followers is a new game, and it does not look easy. No surprise then that most Twitter users have 0-2 followers.<p>Somewhat surprising that, at least in the case of Twitter, they throw you into the social network without any rules or suggestions on how to acquire your initial network – I would bet that the success and retention go one-to-one with user ability to attract some audience.<p>Tomorrow I will try to reply to relevant threads that are gaining traction.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
