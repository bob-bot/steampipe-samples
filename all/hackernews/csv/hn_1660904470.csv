Are there any crimes, technical like piracy, hacking, etc. Or non technical crimes the Government can accuse a citizen of doing that everyone would agree that we would collectively ignore that basic, almost millenium old right first defined in the Magna Carta.<p>With all of the violence and division, threats to weaponize the legal system against political opponents etc, Do you still believe the Govt should prove its case in court?<p>The reason I ask is that I am familiar with a situation where the Govt has accused someone of a crime and all levels of state and federal law enforcement, etc has all agreed this person is basically dead already, has never been arrested for anything, and will get no chance to defend themselves in court.<p>So in summary, is this a situation you would agree with, whether the Constitution in your country guarantees the right to a trial or not.<p>I hope that makes sense.

And to be honest, I feel like I wouldn&#x27;t know where to start with the docs if I do not have a great idea of the workflows, resources and terminologies.<p>I have a working knowledge, the base stuff you learn from Udemy. Basically generating tokens and then making requests blah blah.<p>I want to go deeper than that. I want to understand the underpinnings of Authorization Servers, transport layers and protocols, sessions, management, servers etc.<p>I want to get to a point where I could actually architect (high level) my own Identity Provider. Not that I want to do it, maybe I do, but that is how deep I want to master OAuth.<p>I want to eventually be able to take something like Ory Hydra, break it and customize it to my own liking. I believe this would take more than just understanding what a token or JWT is.<p>So any advice would be dearly appreciated.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We implemented the GoToWebinar-APIs in may 2022. Our customers were quite happy, however we are facing an API-request limit of 500 calls per day. Thus, having an event with 1500 participants takes several days to create using the API.<p>There are ways to lift the API-Client to production-mode by calling the support. And there is the problem: 
GoTo support is refusing or is just unable to help. Several mails and conversations later we still have no solution. Even worse, the support takes two to four weeks to answer requests and is seemingly unwilling to help- I even got asked, whether I want to downgrade my account (???).<p>I&#x27;m actually thinking about ditching the GoTo-integration and move to competitors like Zoom. Even if this will result in an investment of work. Also our clients would not be happy to move to another provider due to their habits. Finally, I don&#x27;t know whether the customer-support is on the same, inacceptable level.<p>Do you have made similar experiences with GoTo or other providers like Zoom?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
