With no time and energy to post individual ads on traditional platforms like Facebook Marketplace, I couldn’t find an easy solution so I decided to create one.<p>Quickly after starting, I realised that it could also benefit sellers from flea markets, yard and car boot sales or even street vendors selling arts and other craft works and that this space was not digitalized.<p>The idea, therefore, became to be able to set up virtual market stalls to sell a bunch of stuff without the need to post individual ads. A sort of shopify for street vendors, self promoted using QR codes in real life.<p>What about item categorisation for buyers? How would they browse?
By location, by keywords, by category, etc. The fields are all optionals for sellers so I add keywords using image recognition algorithms when they upload pictures.<p>I hope this solution will help others too.<p>Looking forward to your feedbacks!",story,https://www.shopmystuff.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
