But my question is why this question gets so many upvotes every time a site that isn&#x27;t responding immediately to someone on the Internet, and their immediate reflex is to ask HN if it&#x27;s down. Like &quot;Yay, I&#x27;m the first to notice! Did you?&quot;<p>It reminds me of when we used to get excited every time modem downloads reached a certainly high cps. It is meaningless and even expected every once in a while.<p>It seems like a really strange behaviour to me, and it is an HN trope by now for something that is a genuinely uninteresting question. Especially since it sometimes it&#x27;s just their own ISP or whatever.<p>Should I be posting my download speeds to keep them excited?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Still, I am curious, specially since the latest blog update is nearly from one year ago, which gets me at least a little suspicious in web world.<p>Any takers?
