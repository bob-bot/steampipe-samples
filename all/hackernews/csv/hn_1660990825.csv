I&#x27;d love some advice.<p>Background for those interested:<p>Act 1. A kid with no product.<p>My first YC interview was 10 years ago. I had a laughable excuse of a product. I only got the interview because I had an unusually fast career growth (CMO of a $180m company by age 23).<p>This remains my only visit to the US.
They rightly sent me packing.<p>Act 2: build skills then build something<p>In the interim I did consulting for a few years. Then I founded my own small company. I taught myself to code properly. And bootstrapped a small SaaS to $20k MRR and applied again. At interview they said the total market isn&#x27;t enough. (They were right.)<p>Act 3: Build something people want.<p>I wrote a list of criteria for my next product and evaluated literally 1000 ideas.<p>The resulting idea is excellent but it&#x27;s technically hard. I&#x27;ve put all the resources of my company and myself into getting it made.<p>Hard to quantify with it being bootstrapped but I&#x27;ve put the resources of my small company into this. Probably 500k of monetary value.<p>Talking to customers it&#x27;s very clear there&#x27;s demand. My small team is excellent.<p>Any advice for this 3rd time around? There&#x27;s clear demand but it&#x27;s hard to simply launch as the product is complex and I want it to work consistently first. I know YC dislikes solo founders, not sure if having a team already in place helps.<p>I am the solo founder but at this point I&#x27;ve background in multiple areas; sold half a mill personally, CMO of a big company, built a team, spent the past few years as an engineer.<p>How best to frame this to YC at this stage? Should I put my team in the video? Should I create a new account to hide that I first interviewed a decade ago?<p>Any advice appreciated. I didn&#x27;t link to my company as I didn&#x27;t want to come across as promoting but will if asked.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
