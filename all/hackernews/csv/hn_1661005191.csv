This game was made with the intention of appealing to those who like games similar to Sudoku.<p>I actually released this as a native app in 2018 (for both iOS and Android), however the rules were a bit too complicated for the initial release (the game used to allow for diagonal movements). Since the general feedback about the game was positive, and since I was looking for an excuse to play with and learn React, I decided to remake the game as a web app with slightly different rules than the original version.<p>I hope you enjoy it, and I&#x27;d very much love to hear your feedback and suggestions!",story,https://playnumari.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
