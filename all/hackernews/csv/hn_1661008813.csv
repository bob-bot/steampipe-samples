32532430,Ask HN: I automated part of someone else's job in my free time – how to proceed?,2022-08-20T14:49:06Z,JGugtw,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello HN<p>I&#x27;ve been working at this company for some time in an administrative role. As part of my job, we – and many others – work with data which gets aggregated and refined by a centralized team of specialists. This process is only partially automated and therefore still quite heavy-handed. As I understand it, significant time is spent on the manual part of it all.<p>Out of curiosity I started building this small project in my free time just to see if I could automate it myself, since most of the data required is available open source. There are still many rough edges but what I have now is already superior to what we have at work.<p>Now I&#x27;m wondering about where to go from here - so far I haven&#x27;t told anyone. Strictly speaking, this is not part of my job and I am &quot;poaching&quot; in someone else&#x27;s area of expertise. I like my job and don&#x27;t want to make enemies. On the other hand, I would love to see my solution put to use and maybe even enhance and&#x2F;or expand it jointly with IT. However, this is code I wrote in my free time and I am rather unwilling to give it away without any benefit.<p>Any ideas?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
