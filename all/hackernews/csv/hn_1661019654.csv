32533851,Show HN: Madepublic – a platform for indiemakers building in public now in beta,2022-08-20T17:49:43Z,bustylasercanon,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"My name is Chris, I&#x27;m the solo founder and builder of madepublic!<p>I started building madepublic over a month ago when I wanted to build a different application in public and found the options available to me lacking. Tweets and Twitter threads are good for reach but poor for organisation, information and sharing details about the projects themselves. Other platforms simply didn&#x27;t have the features I wanted or were simply far too expensive to use - madepublic.io was built to address that, and create a place for founders and indiemakers to show off their offerings and help others with transparent, and honest accounts of their products journey.<p>Around a week ago I posted on &#x2F;r&#x2F;sideproject with some great feedback, I&#x27;ve incorporated all of it, added features and tightened things up for beta!<p>Currently on the platform, you can create an account, a profile and several projects. Your profile can house a bio, a profile image and numerous links to social accounts.<p>Your projects are where things really get interesting - each project on madepublic.io let&#x27;s you display information about the product including:<p>- Motivations - why the project exists and it&#x27;s goals
- Technical stack (or no-code) tags
- Project toolbox (tools and resources used to build the project)
- A public feed to outline updates and changes, categorised and accompanied by emojis
- Status
- Links to the product itself, Twitter &amp; Facebook
- Real-time updating statistics regarding page impressions, link clicks and entries
- Project logo<p>In the coming weeks, I&#x27;ll be adding additional features such as:<p>- A way for users to request features &amp; submit bug reports to each project
- Project polls to help you decide between different choices
- A public to-do list for each project
- A way to promote your project on the homepage
- A dashboard instead of a marketing landing page
- Lots, lots more<p>Madepublic is currently 100% free to use - in the future it may introduce a pro plan with additional features but every existing feature today will remain entirely free.<p>Please use the link below to create your madepublic account and begin your journey with us.

I think it may have been by someone from the BSD camp, as opposed as to someone from Linux. The slides from the talk really elegantly addressed issues about the kind of devices and various complexities around abstracting driver interfaces whilst dealing with differing protocols, hardware interfaces, and other issues. I would really appreciate finding this talk again. Please help, I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t provide more details.
