32534550,Ask HN: Is it time for AI to start replacing doctors?,2022-08-20T19:26:52Z,eth0up,2,false,false,6,"[32534872,32534676,32534599]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello wizards and apprentices,<p>Most people, regardless of their politics, understand that healthcare, notably in the US, is too often unaffordable and sometimes destructive through financial means.<p>Many doctors, from my observations, function as pen pushers in what seems an administrative bureaucracy, relying as often as not, on remembered-information rather than improvisation or critical thinking. Many of the conditions they treat or medicate are done so in an almost automated manner. In many cases, a nurse would suffice at a much lower cost.<p>Obviously those who sacrifice a decade of their lives to study medicine desire and deserve to be rewarded. The discretion and experience that comes with such an immersive decade is of undeniably great value. However, I am convinced AI could rival a significant portion of what they do, theoretically at a drastically lower cost.<p>We (or some of we) trust AI to pilot vehicles, some of them weighing 80,000 lbs. We (some of we) trust AI with many serious matters; it could be argued that it has already begun replacing professionals at the PhD level, eg psychologists (Fusion Centers, law enforcement, pre-crime, etc). There&#x27;s social credit and Trust Scores and more. Clearly we (some of we) are willing, if not eager to shirk our burdens and responsibilities onto artificial shoulders. Why not include, at least one, application that might have a clear, unambiguous and tangible benefit to the majority?<p>I think the Hippocratic oath is very amenable in this direction.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
