Don&#x27;t there to be all asset light, it is a mistake as inflation favors asset and many of the customer will be sticky all because of the logistics structure and asset all together. (So raise money early and go all in on Asset.<p>I hope to look back on this and have give away some wisdom and recipe to the success of what we are building, all together it has been a very tough journey and all thanks to grant and supportive founding team to have survive in an industry of low margin and tremendous impact.
