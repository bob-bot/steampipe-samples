32535238,Ask HN: Resources for learning networking for back end development,2022-08-20T21:23:47Z,tusharvaswani,4,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello everyone,
I am a frontend developer and I am trying to shift to backend development. I am studying directly from Node JS docs but I have realised that most of their networking modules are hard to understand without have a knowledge of networking  . So searched google for resources but didnt find a single resource. All resources were in depth covering those OSI layers that a backend developer would not need. So anyone please suggest me some resources(videos, books, articles anything) for studying networking but for a level of backend engineer.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

But, for bulk sending of marketing emails, I&#x27;ve only found services that depend on number of contacts we have such as MailChimp. It is just prohibitively expensive because we send a marketing email for announcements of new products, usually once or twice a year. For this, it makes little sense to continue paying $600-$1000 &#x2F; year for MailChimp.<p>Curious, is there a better &quot;hacky&quot; way to send emails? I don&#x27;t need analytics and a whole bunch of templating features like on MailChimp. I can manage my own mailing list just fine in Postgres. I simply need an API and I&#x27;ve heard bad things about using AWS SES for bulk emails.<p>Looking for a low budget infrequent mass email service, I&#x27;d appreciate some insight.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
