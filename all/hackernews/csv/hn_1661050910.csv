Outside of my FANG I was a go-getter who loves learning new things and taking on hard problems. Inside my company I have tried over the past 2 years to propose different solutions to hard problems and I just get blown off.<p>I’m good at my job I already got promoted in 1 year and am moving up. I am making more money than I expected, but at work I’m not able to express myself creatively or do things outside the box. I just get assigned straightforward work from my manager that the product managers and “leadership” assign to our team with barely any input on the overall project or ability to propose new projects.<p>I feel like if I stay here I will just get stuck in a cycle of never accomplishing my goals but I’m scared to move teams or companies or build a startup because I have a good manager, a good comp and my job isn’t that stressful.<p>I could become more involved at work in building paper reading groups or other kinds of side projects to creatively express myself at work but I don’t want to be the person whose life revolves around their FANG.<p>Anyone else feel like this?

32536886,Ask HN: Are there any languages for programming-in-the-large?,2022-08-21T02:28:25Z,khaledh,2,false,false,2,"[32537027,32537020]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"Almost every programming language in existence today focuses on programming-in-the-small: types, classes, functions, control flow, etc. This is OK for putting together small programs. But when it comes to designing large, complex systems, it&#x27;s really up to the programmer&#x2F;team to define the design out-of-band (docs, diagrams, conventions, etc) and then use the programming language to implement the design.<p>Are there programming languages that help with the high-level design of programs? Concepts in such a language could be: system, subsystem, component, composite, constraint, plugin, interface&#x2F;protocol, data flow, storage, async process, etc. Note that this is not about distributed system design; all the above elements could be in the same process.<p>Another important aspect is help with defining a meta-model of a system. A program meta-model fills some gaps between the language model and the actual domain model of the program. For example, a meta-model of a front-end UI library could define the concept of unidirectional data flow, which enforces data flow in one direction.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
