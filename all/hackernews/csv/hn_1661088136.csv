Description text. Maybe some mockups...<p>I&#x27;ve tried to make it so that it&#x27;s quick and easy to just dump an idea in there that&#x27;s been sitting on some list of yours for months - and hopefully get some feedback on it.<p>If someone else on the site sees your idea and likes it, they have various choices of showing support:<p>They can upvote.<p>They can subscribe to progress updates.<p>They can tell you why they want it (there&#x27;s a questionaire that is loosely based on &quot;The Mom Test&quot;).<p>And they can even send you money as encouragement.<p>As the owner of an idea, you can see how many unique upvotes, subscriptions, etc. your idea has received. You get a nice table of all the ideas you have on the site, sorted by feedback score. Also, in the case of non-anonymous subscriptions or donations, you can get in touch with early supporters.<p>Publicly, though, neither upvotes nor any other form of support for an idea are shown. This is so you cannot go to the site and just grab the most popular ideas from there. And also so that each idea can get the same amount of exposure and attention.<p>There are many great books out there on validating startup ideas. And my site won&#x27;t be a replacement for those. Rather, it&#x27;s designed as a low hanging fruit to get your idea out there.<p>I hope some of you find it useful. Feel free to test it out on the ideas I&#x27;ve posted on there. And perhaps share some of your own!<p>Also curious to hear your feedback both on the idea itself and the execution so far.<p>The site is still early beta. Please let me know if you run into any bugs. Also, and ideas how I can make it better would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks!",story,https://ideas.dynamate.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
