Vivaldi&#x27;s behavior will get 401 error on fetch-ing &#x2F;cdn-cgi&#x2F;challenge-platform&#x2F;h&#x2F;g&#x2F;pat&#x2F;xxx&#x2F;xxx&#x2F;xxx&#x2F;xxx while Edge will get 400 error upon xhr-ing &#x2F;cdn-cgi&#x2F;challenge-platform&#x2F;h&#x2F;g&#x2F;flow&#x2F;ov1&#x2F;xxx&#x2F;xxx&#x2F;xxx. I cannot investigate deeper than this since I don&#x27;t have time and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com&#x2F;cdn-cgi&#x2F;challenge-platform&#x2F;h&#x2F;g&#x2F;orchestrate&#x2F;jsch&#x2F;v1?ray=xxx JS file is obfuscated.<p>Honestly at this point I&#x27;m using Firefox at temporary solution whenever a site got stuck in this ridiculous refresh loop and I have no idea why.<p>I did have uBlock Origin installed on both Firefox and Vivaldi with same exact settings and filter lists (since I exported and imported them) and both success and fail cases have the extension enabled. There&#x27;s also Adguard in the background disabled for both cases.<p>In some rare cases Cloudfare outright ONLY block my Vivaldi browser instead of having access to the DDoS test page. Usually clear site data will &quot;fix&quot; and it goes back to stuck in the same refresh loop.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
