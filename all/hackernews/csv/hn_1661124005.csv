However, thinking about it more, I’m starting to suspect that it might be somewhat inherent to the fact that these jobs are part of the economy, and as such, the day-to-day is eventually driven by doing whatever makes money for the company.
Maybe that’s why many of us have side projects.<p>So my question is, is there anyone here who can say that they love their job?
If so, what is that you do? How did you get there?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
