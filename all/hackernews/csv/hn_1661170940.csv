A little background on me and I&#x27;m sure many of you relate:<p>- I&#x27;ve been a web dev in the UK for around 10 years now, it kills my soul. Lots of startup snakery over the years, company using and abusing you, mass-layoffs nowadays or years prior etc.<p>- I feel very manipulated and used in this industry behind all the smiles and creepy niceties. By managers, PMs and even other devs who are lapdogs of upper management (then those same devs get fired later for made-up reasons when they do the dirty work of management). I find it hard to genuinely trust anyone, yes, even the ones with &quot;bring your dog to work&quot; &#x2F; &quot;free Friday lunches!&quot; &#x2F; super-friendly staff &#x2F; engineering managers who look like they read a book on how to speak like a friendly manager &#x2F; other BS<p>- My creativity and drive to create side projects outside of work hours is gone. I don&#x27;t remember the last time I coded for fun or with the intention to make money off it. Most weekends are spent trying to &quot;heal&quot; from the week, same for outside work hours. I get better at disengaging whenever needed nowadays though.<p>- On the plus side, I&#x27;m quite financially well off because of web dev and paid off my cheap mortgage (I live well below my means, super frugal, no dependents) and have 1 property I let out. I&#x27;m tempted to keep on this path as I know nothing else professionally.<p>- Now that every one calls themselves a developer, bootcamps churning out devs that know the exact same thing as seniors (on paper), I&#x27;m not sure if this will drive salaries down in 5-10+ years time or would our jobs even exist then? Don&#x27;t even get me started on interview processes and how high their standards have become such that you will get disqualified over minutiae.<p>- So I do am tempted to quit, but don&#x27;t know what else to do, so I was curious what you guys who have been disillusioned by this industry have done and are doing nowadays?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
