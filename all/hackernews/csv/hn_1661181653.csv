And also I would like to see the discoveries of other folks who I know I like.<p>So I started creating the tool I wish I had in the first place. In Digs, the basic idea is that:<p>- you can add music releases (albums, EPs, singles, mixes) in three lists: Want to Listen, Listened, Digged. You can also use tags and notes to better organize these lists.<p>- you get a public profile where your activity is visible (i.e. what you added to your lists). Example profile: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digs.fm&#x2F;alskn"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digs.fm&#x2F;alskn</a>.<p>- you can add other people as friends. Then you&#x27;ll see their activity in your home feed.<p>- you can either like or add a comment to any activity  of your friends (or yours)<p>- you can explicitly recommend a release to one of your friends<p>This is very early yet and there are a lot of rough edges.<p>You can find a few screenshots of the basic functionality in the homepage, from where you can also create an account - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digs.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digs.fm</a>.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback, thanks in advance!<p>---------<p>EDIT: I figured it&#x27;s worth expanding a bit on some highlights:<p>- In the search box, apart from searching, you can copy&#x2F;paste any release URL from Discogs&#x2F;Spotify&#x2F;Bandcamp&#x2F;Mixcloud&#x2F;MusicBrainz and it will basically fetch the release and then you can add it to your lists.<p>- There are browser extensions for Firefox and Chrome, so that when you&#x27;re on some of the aforementioned sites, and you stumbled upon an interesting album, you can click the extension icon and the item will be added to your &quot;Want to Listen&quot; list.<p>- For certain releases, you&#x27;ll notice there&#x27;s an embedded web player, for convenience.",story,https://digs.fm,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
