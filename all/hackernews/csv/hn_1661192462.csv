At the same time I use lots of sites and services that are ad powered and I am blocking ads knowing full well that I deprive these providers from a revenue stream. But ads are just too obnoxious.<p>Would it be possible to create a service that serves up &#x27;blank&#x27; content (let&#x27;s call it &#x27;whitespace&#x27;) in every ad spot on the sites that you visit but that uses the same mechanism as the ad delivery services. So instead of advertisers buying up the space <i>I</i> would buy up the space on the sites that I visit creating a revenue stream that is as good or better than the one that advertisers would offer, effectively crowding them out.<p>OpenRTB or something like that would be a good start to inject this because you could essentially become your own agency there but I&#x27;m not sure how easy it would be to qualify for bidding on a large enough segment to make it worth your while. And on the off chance that an alternative channel would try to deliver ads anyway that could simply be blocked.<p>So, what&#x27;s your judgment, is this a viable proposition or not, and if not why not?<p>And if it were available would you use it?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
