32556290,Ask HN: Should I tell cofounders/investors to optimize my env before startup?,2022-08-22T19:48:26Z,amts,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I keep my Aspiring Founder profile active in the Co-founder Match platform at Startup School and despite having written very low information density stuff in the profile, a few people contacted me regarding co-founding and applying to a batch in another accelerator.<p>My main startup idea is in agritech, but it is malleable and scalable to many adjacent fields as well. In the majority of agritech you may not need to survey what users want, as the majority of users in this field just want better yields.
Apart from making notes, collecting information about the field and conducting some sparse pilot research in the field, I as a founder haven&#x27;t done much about it for years for various reasons.<p>Currently I need to repair my habitable property in Lithuania and I can basically do 80% of this myself, so won&#x27;t have time for optimal work on a startup. Any of this property is not suitable for optimal work, so I may need to flip or rent it.

I work for a large FAANG-ish company on problems related to large distributed software systems. By most measures, I&#x27;m pretty successful, &quot;Sr&quot; in my title and whatnot.<p>But lately I&#x27;m suffering the burnout&#x2F;apathy&#x2F;midlife-crisis that seems so common, and I&#x27;m wondering if a big shift might be warranted. This last weekend, I was thinking that exploring some other area of engineering might be interesting. Right now, something physical sounds interesting: structural, electrical, mechanical etc. (Heck, right this minute, even carpentry sounds good.) I have near-zero experience with these worlds.<p>The salaries for these positions are all half of what I&#x27;m making now or even less, which might be fine if I was sure that I&#x27;d be into it, but I&#x27;d like to <i>get</i> sure.<p>I&#x27;m thinking a &quot;baby step&quot; toward an alternate career might be to go work on the software that powers them, where the structural&#x2F;electrical&#x2F;mechanical engineer is the customer, using software or physical products that I&#x27;m writing code for. Ideally, I&#x27;d work at a place where I could interact with customers directly, though I realize that may not really be how things work. My thinking is that I could get some exposure to those worlds without totally retooling and taking that risk.<p>Does that seem crazy? What opportunities might be available that I haven&#x27;t thought of?
