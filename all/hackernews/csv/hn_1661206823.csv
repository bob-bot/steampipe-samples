However, it used to be I was curious about many things so it would work out. For example, I took a break from schooling when I was 11-12 and I was able to master math, science, and coding. I&#x27;d read an entire book in one go, spend days on one math problem, Debug code for 5+ days.<p>But I essentially had no internet access, then I got the internet and came competitive gaming, seeking public reward came to be the norm for me, yahoo answers, then youtube, then multiple tabs in chrome... now i can&#x27;t even watch videos longer than 2 minutes, i cant read comments longer than 2 sentences, i actually hate talking in full sentences.. instead just feel inclined to use acronyms: lol, wdu?, sus, ngl, g, cap, gl... I find myself trying to come up with funny comments for reddit all day (sad actually), obsessively updating news sites for no reason...I have 80+ tabs open any time, (all todo readings)<p>I struggle to code for day job.<p>Obviously social media is a big culprit, my question is something wrong with me in addition to that? I still can focus on things that I&#x27;ve innate interest in (got fascinated with video editing and taught myself after effects after obsessively learning from all resources)<p>I found writing physically on a notebook kinda helped me, also going on long drives 4+ hours and reading a book (one time i knew i was gonna go so found a book i could read and didn&#x27;t wanna use mobile data, ended up reading half the book and came back home and read the rest... huge accomplishment for me to read the whole book)<p>on good sleep days im better<p>now that i think about it i always had this side to me, rewards didn&#x27;t motivate me, punishment didn&#x27;t matter. good grades, more money, reputation... led to some temporary motivation, only thing that motivated me was if it was intellectually interesting if not i knew i should do it but just couldn&#x27;t bring inner me to accept the compromise.<p>so what do you do, or i should do?<p>I understand none of the comments are medical advice",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
