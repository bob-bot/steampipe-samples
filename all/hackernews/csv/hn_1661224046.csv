https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;dBFXPSx<p>I got let go from DoorDash at more than 9 months and got the worst possible review right before my 1 year (annual vesting) stock vested, worth 6x during IPO ($600k) first year. A crow and a dead bird appeared on the roof. There was a roll of bills left at the garage door a week prior but they never gave me any contract to sign. On my actual firing, there was a pink sticky paper (pink slip) at my garage door. Weeks later, a receipt from that Saturday was left at the door showing people having a large meal. When I finally got a new job a year later, there was a shampagne cork at my garage door.<p>I ask our current employer Mark Zuckerberg at Meta as well as Tony from DoorDash, if he’s not responsible, to please assist with our safety.<p>Dec 2021 - Mar 2022<p>In late November, I got a chance to dance with BTS Jin in the front row in late November, and millions of people clicked Like on Twitter and TikTok.<p>When I got home, the entry doors in MV apt and SF townhouse found having been visited, locks moved, scratching ground when opening. Similarly, car doors unlocked repeatedly for the next months. One of the cars had the license plate stolen and green paint was applied to the side. Sticky stuff was put on the top of the door to get fingerprints (?) not sure to use when.<p>July 2022<p>Someone drew an X in front of the MV door when I went to visit it. I was told it might be the people marking the right unit for fixing a kitchen. However, loud car noises were made by people in the parking lot.<p>I went to SF and heard the same loud noises from cars outside.<p>Sometimes sounds are projected into the SF house from the street. However, when I’m in the SF bathroom, I don’t hear anything, except that I can tell the sounds are near the windows &#x2F; exterior door &#x2F; balcony door.<p>These sounds are wall knocks and clings projected into the house from the side street.<p>Once I went outside late last week there was a car at each side of the gate, and they sped off loudly. Then I didn’t hear any weird noises inside or outside the house.<p>Aug 2022<p>August 1st, the loud car noises stopped for some days (as well as other sounds). Later on, I got a new computer that I ordered through my work computer, and started moving files to it.<p>So normally, it’s hard to hear any car or a voice outside because I face a side street. But it was very clear when I was typing an email to DoorDash and the internet connection was slow and delayed like it was being filtered out. And also a car projected a very loud, like 10x loud car noise. That’s how I knew they’re projecting &#x2F; magnifying sound into the rooms through the windows or the roof.<p>Once again, when I’m in the SF bathroom during those times, I don’t hear anything, except that noises coming through the windows. The SF bathroom is surrounded by other townhouse units (no windows).<p>My internet connection and my spouse’s internet connection in different cities suffered for those 3-4 days, as if our conversations were being monitored and filtered.<p>Also, shortly after I stopped writing the email, a car drove in and threw a rock on the roof. It landed in a spot I saw minutes later, that it wasn’t there 1 hour earlier when I was up on the roof. Also a crow flew up there.<p>Leaving for MV<p>I found my automatic lock in SF could not be reset no matter how, so I swapped the bottom lock for a new one when I was leaving to MV. Like I said, cars drove away loudly and the weird sounds in the house stopped.<p>Later that day in MV, after I came home after Castro St, the crow sounds continued when I went there and walked home. Also, there were 4 people, 3 with white bags near by. Two were on bicycles in the dark with large white paper bags. One had a large white grocery bag exactly at our mailbox.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
