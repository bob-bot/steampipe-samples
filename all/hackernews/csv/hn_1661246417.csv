The thesis of the book is that &quot;code is for humans&quot;. The book explains how to write code that is optimal for our primitive monkey brains. The book describes how many of the best practices in software stem from deficiencies in our cognitive abilities. It expands on best practices such as (DRY, SSOT, etc) and brings new ideas on what is good code and how to write it.<p>I am looking for someone to partner with on this book as it&#x27;s a huge project and I would love to be able to split the work.<p>A bit about me: I worked as the software architect of a 100+ person team at Mobileye&#x2F;Intel and have many, many years of experience working on a large variety of software.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

* The SSL traffic generated by the applications that people use the certificate for could be &#x27;MITM&#x27;ed or decrypted<p><pre><code>  - Again, if it&#x27;s local development, I can&#x27;t see a difference over hosting local applications without any SSL encryption
</code></pre>
Maybe I&#x27;m missing something else? If not, how has something like this not already been done?<p>On the flip side, am I right in thinking this _would_ solve real-life problems that people face?<p>Certainly feels easier than using tunneling software that SSL-wraps the traffic (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;localtunnel&#x2F;localtunnel) - though obviously this is only a small benefit of using applications like that (i.e. making your local development environment publicly accessible).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
