In recent years it got more and more “personalized” instead of explorable and I simply cannot discover content that fits my interests. Every time I watched &lt;topic&gt; video either out of short interest or accidentally, the feed got flooded with low-int clones (not that it was good before that, new nonsense simply replaced the old one). Not interested and don’t recommend channel buttons do not work anymore. Browse channels is full of generic attention seekers. Search is irrelevant. Out of desperation I tried to turn watch history on and off, that didn’t help. I then deleted my watch history, most playlists and subs and instead of becoming neutral, the feed is now full of korean girls day vlogs, cats and pseudophilosophy.<p>In previous few years yt felt like a dumb kid following you everywhere and presenting things similar to what you enjoyed yesterday and got enough of. You could yell at it sometimes, it was bearable but not funny. Now it’s full-on dementia and I can do nothing. It’s sad because I know that creators and topics I’d love (and maybe don’t know about yet) are out there somewhere, and the only barrier between me and them is this algorithmic prison.<p>I wanted to finish with some constructive discussion cues, but it made me too sad, hope HN will figure it out if needed.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
