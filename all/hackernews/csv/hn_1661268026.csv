Why SMS? It&#x27;s quiet, calm, accessible, and you don&#x27;t have to wade through newsletters, popups, ads, social rankings, endlessly scrolling cover photos, and thousands of mass-market reviews just to figure out if you might want to read a book.<p>I know there are a lot of people working on book discovery apps and alternatives to Goodreads, but none of that interests me as a reader. I don&#x27;t need social features, public reading lists, suggestions from the algorithm, or digital bookshelves. I want recommendations I can trust from people with similar literary tastes, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m working to build.<p>Quick details:<p>* You opt-in to receive texts, start your subscription via Stripe.<p>* We recommend a book twice a month via text message.<p>* At launch, we&#x27;ll provide guidance on where to find the book. Soon, you can buy the book directly from us.<p>* No need to create an account, log in, or manage a cart to checkout.<p>* Text messaging available only in the US and Canada; shipping only in the US to start.<p>Current status:<p>* Sharing this publicly to see if it resonates. You can send an email (in my profile) to get on the waiting list.<p>* Learning about text message opt-in laws and deliverability gotchas, and figuring out which SMS tool to use.<p>* Rounding up people who have a similar literary taste to help write recommendations.<p>* Opening accounts with book wholesalers and publishers.<p>* Trying to sync subscription status from Stripe to Heymarket, though I&#x27;m at the edges of my technical know-how with the APIs. I&#x27;m currently using Zapier (god has it gone to shit) to sync subscription status to Heymarket contacts but would like to build something less clumsy, more robust.<p>Challenges:<p>The biggest challenge is the bookstore side of the business—it&#x27;s a real hurdle and may not be practical, even if I sent orders to a large distributor, like Ingram. It&#x27;s likely that I&#x27;ll launch with recommendations only, provide ISBNs and sources for buying the book in the text message—no marketing or affiliate links. From there, I&#x27;ll figure out next steps for the bookstore.<p>Note that the language on the website is still a work in progress, the recommendation that&#x27;s on the site is just a copy&#x2F;paste sample, but wanted to show what I&#x27;m going for. That section will scroll through previously recommended books once I&#x27;ve got them added.<p>I&#x27;ll be ready to test and to start adding people to the list the week after next.<p>Your comments and suggestions are appreciated.",story,https://sundaybooks.org,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I made this Windows desktop app that allows using voice activation with games or apps that only support push-to-talk.<p>The initial version was written years ago, without any UI or configuration options. It was just for my personal use. I had told a few friends about it, though, and then one of them asked if he could get a copy to use with Discord priority speaker, since for years, it has only worked with push-to-talk. So I spent some time making a more user-friendly version.<p>It&#x27;s written almost exclusively in C and uses Nuklear [1] for the UI. It has an auto updater. The releases are hashed with BLAKE3 and signed with ECC.<p>I also recently made an open source USB device [2] that the app can use to send input from a &quot;real&quot; keyboard because, it turns out, there are some games (CSGO) that ignore simulated input for activating the microphone.<p>I&#x27;m having some trouble finding users though. I&#x27;ve tried posting on a few Discord servers and subreddits for games whose players I suspect would find the app useful but self-promotion and advertising are generally not allowed in these communities, so my posts get removed quite quickly.

We&#x27;re a team of two Pakistani brothers who like to build things. Every year we have a tradition of hacking together a fun project on the side, to learn and solve a niche problem.<p>The idea of GitTrends came from the open-source work that we do in our daily jobs. We noticed how difficult it was to see when our repositories or developers were trending. For an event that can cause such an impact on open-source work, we thought there should be a dedicated solution. So we built it!<p>GitTrends allows you to search a database of GitHub Trending data that we collect every 5th minute. With a small fee, you can also subscribe for email alerts for a specific repository or Github username that you are interested in observing. Knowing that your watched repository or username is trending can significantly give you a burst of popularity on your repository or developer profile, which you can then take advantage of. For an open-source developer looking for work, or a small project that needs more eyes, getting on trending can be a game-changer.<p>As a note, we started collecting data in August 2022. We are looking for volunteers who would help us load historical data (i.e. from the BigQuery GitHub Dataset) to our database.<p>We&#x27;ve launched on ProductHunt as well, so an upvote there would be massively helpful -&gt; <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;gittrends"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;gittrends</a>.<p>Thank you!",story,https://www.gittrends.xyz/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
