32573473,Tell HN: I’ve had an offer pulled from under me,2022-08-24T00:25:31Z,HighlandSpring,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey so, I rarely take the time and effort to post online because I don’t tend to have much to say but figured this would be a really ripe time to have a cheeky rant on the big orange internet forums.<p>On 25th May of this year I interviewed with a London-based gambling company for a full-time Scala role. It was a really compact process: 3x 1h interview all in one go, 1pm to 4pm. I was utterly cognitively ruined at the end by the tech drilling and the live coding but 2 days later an offer email with my exact expectation materialised: 26.7% payrise on base with a cherry on top. The best part? They were happy with a 12th September start! I could wrap up all the things I was working on at my current company and move on without leaving a smell! T’s crossed and i’s dotted.<p>At some point the recruiter asked me if I’m interviewing with any other companies, “honestly, no, I’m getting too old to be running multiple interviews at a time” I said smugly (which is funny because I’m 27). I already knew I was going to get what I want without having to complicate my life to get it, I was finally senior enough.<p>Turns out I was quite wrong. A week later it was announced that this company was acquired by a larger company but I didn’t learn about this until a week or two ago which I paid no mind to. On 23rd August, approaching 5pm I got a call from someone from HR at my future company informing me that the offer no longer stands. Turns out, following their acquisition they were doing a “review of their required skills and capabilities” and well, that was it. I was a little annoyed but before long I was doubly annoyed about how long and apologetic the phonecall was getting. Must be a really hard job to deliver a batch of “your offer is no more” phone calls and waiting for the person on the other side to feel sufficiently informed to end the call even though there’s very little more to say once the intial news is given. Yikes<p>Anyway, I’m cynical enough to understand that no company owes me anything, especially not a job I haven’t started yet. It’s still a bit annoying, 3 weeks out from starting date.<p>Luckily I’m not above naming and shaming: the company in question is William Hill, following it’s acquisition by 888.<p>Some thoughts:<p>1. I appreciate this is an obnoxiously fortunate position to be in to begin with. As far as life drama goes, this is pretty constructed. Please excuse.<p>2. Is this what I get for taking an offer from a gambling company? My hunch was gambling means stability (especially an est. 1934 company)<p>3. Interviewing is such a performing act. How you feel that day can make such a difference, not looking forward to feeling like a performing monkey all over again.<p>Rant over,<p>MP",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Trying to cobble together a DIY portable digital typewriter, terminal. RaspPi, small external USB keyboard, and eInk display. Code in the sun. EInk doesn’t seem to be there yet, but I got to thinking- why not try out a monochrome LCD, like the screens on graphic calculators. Maybe I’m not searching in the right corners of Amazon or Alibaba, but I haven’t been able to find a black &amp; white LCD screen with HDMI input. Has anyone been down this route and have suggestions? Gracias.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
