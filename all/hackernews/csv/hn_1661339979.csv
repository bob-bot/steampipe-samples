32577609,Ask HN: Mature tools for availability when app shutdown outside of buisness hour,2022-08-24T10:50:28Z,azebazenestor,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello,<p>I just joined a new company in the observability team. We used Datadog for observability. Datadog support computing app availability based on unsuccessful monitoring checks that can happen. However as i learned when joining the company, this won&#x27;t work in our case.<p>Why? : The vast majority ( 500+) of the company app don&#x27;t run 24*7, they have different business hours ( like 9-5) but outside of these business hours, apps are shutdown. So for example for a 9-5 , app will be shutdown at 5 and restart tomorrow at 9. And Datadog don&#x27;t support that. It has maintenance window but they can not be scheduled, the same is valid for monitoring mute.<p>So the team ( I was not there at this moment) tried to code a scheduler to send through API maintenance windows each day but the datadog availability computation was not correct.They decided to build their own tool which took as sources: datadog unsuccessful checks + table of business hours per app and allow to calculate app availability. The results were correct.<p>However as I joined the team, I found that this code will be very difficult to maintain at longer term. So if someone knows a tool ( preferably opensource but i am open) that can help, i am interested.
PS: The tool can&#x27;t be a datadog alternative because the observability platform can be changed.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
