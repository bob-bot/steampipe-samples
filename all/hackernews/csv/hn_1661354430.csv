Once learners successfully completed one project through coding practice he would get a reward badge. with these badges accumulation, he would get higher level reward such as coding cheatsheet and game authoring disclosure docs.<p>Learning how to code is a big challenge for kids, even for smart kids those concept are always abstract and hard to understand. So, I made this tool to help young beginner to lower the doorsill through all possible approaches including game, video, text..and so on.

At most I may get the occasional &quot;oh yeah, I still get tired myself sometimes...&quot; but still a funny look nonetheless.<p>Being &quot;tired sometimes&quot; is not being unable to breathe and oxygen levels dropping like crazy for no reason, or having liver failure, or unexpected and sudden hemorrhages, heart disease that came out of nowhere ( 100% healthy and very fit before COVID ) and a million other things which make life very miserable and difficult. In short, being disabled.<p>And yet people react as if it&#x27;s made up.<p>I know I am lucky as anxiety does not cause hemorrhages or unexplained liver failure, or a number of things that happen with this disease. I feel for those with &quot;simple&quot; migraines, or the like, who can&#x27;t even find &quot;comfort&quot; in a doctor rushing them to the ER because clearly you need to be there right now -- no psychosomatic anything here, you get to the hospital or things get very ugly very quick.<p>How do you deal with this problem ?
