Over the years both our salaries went up about the same until we both got to the $100k mark.  About 5 years ago her career has really accelerated and her total comp is 2.5x what I&#x27;m making.  On top of her salary, she hit the startup lotto and had a large cash buyout.<p>We had a hard time dealing with this at first, I was jealous and a little bitter, and she was worried that I was taking advantage of the situation.  In the end, we decided that the buyout money would go to retirement and not be touched.  As for out salary, we decided that we would both spend as if we both made my salary, and anything above that, she would put in a rainy day fund for home improvements or traveling etc.  This arrangement kind of worked until it came time to use that rainy day funds and she started feeling that we were spending her money.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of this situation with Lawyers&#x2F;Doctors where one spouse supported the other while they went to school, but once they started to practice, the income spread was huge.

It&#x27;s on their own GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ethereum&#x2F;go-ethereum<p>But the 5 consensus clients not only have websites which aren&#x27;t ethereum.org - they are in fact also hosted on different GitHub accounts:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sigp&#x2F;lighthouse<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChainSafe&#x2F;lodestar<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;status-im&#x2F;nimbus-eth1 (yes, this is also for eth2, see &quot;About&quot; at top right)<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;prysmaticlabs&#x2F;prysm<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Consensys&#x2F;teku<p>Further, all of these 5 institutions seem to be companies from the looks of their website, not non-profit foundations. (Please correct me and pardon me if that is not true, I don&#x27;t have the time to navigate through all these websites to figure out their precise legal status.)<p>So is it true that there is <i>no</i> official reference implementation to run the post-Merge, Proof of Stake Ethereum?<p>Only 3rd party software which is somehow endorsed but which you have to choose on your own still?<p>Sure, more choice can be nice, but it would seem advantageous to have at least one trustworthy reference client instead of the users having to decide which of 5 commercial entities they trust?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
