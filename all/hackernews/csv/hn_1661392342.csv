It seems if someone is even slightly controversial they are wiped out off internet in due time. People don&#x27;t even care about freedom of speech, sites collectively have started to disable comments. It used to be we would learn how important freedom of speech is through people like Voltaire, George Orwell, and so on. And how it formed the basis of our govt and how it has shaped our society and systems, often always for the better. Yet it feels right now people don&#x27;t really care about principles and more interested in subduing the other side on all mediums. Almost feels like society as deteriorated a bit, concept of free speech is leaving fabric of society altogether. On campuses, on tvs, on social platforms. Whenever someone gets banned, it&#x27;s welcomed. It&#x27;s now known as cancel culture which celebrates censorship, just with different cover up term. Almost scary how irrelevant this principle is becoming.<p>Right now companies are shielded from liabilities of user generated content, but they also engage in selective editing. The new law was saying that a platform is either just a host of user generated content or an editor in which case responsible for the content, it can&#x27;t claim to be a host and then edit selectively.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
