But while analyzing a performance or latency related issues I think it will help to know the performance of the external systems as well. This can quickly point out any issues due to a downstream system or even a DB. I understand that these systems will also have these metrics available but they don&#x27;t always paint the complete picture. For instance they will not include network latencies.<p>But on the flip side I wonder will this mean generating a lot data and maybe as well lead to increasing latency of the current API.<p>I wonder if this is a practice in the industry?
