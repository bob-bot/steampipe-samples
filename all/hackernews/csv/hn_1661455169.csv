32598603,Launch HN: Artemis (YC S22) – Use comments to give code an interactive interface,2022-08-25T19:16:26Z,austinmccoy6251,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello Hacker News, we’re Austin, Manvir, and Kyle, the cofounders of Artemis Labs
(<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artemisdevtool.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artemisdevtool.com</a>). We turn your in-line comments into a UI that can be used to
visualize, test, document and share your code. This helps engineers and scientists quickly
create quality scripts.<p>Artemis was born in a Caltech robotics lab where I saw firsthand how much time and effort it
took to create a quality script. Valuable engineers were spending hundreds of hours making
slide decks, hybrid Markdown &#x2F; LaTeX documents, and demo GUIs just to make their tools
accessible and usable by others. As someone who has been on the learning end of things, it
can be nearly impossible to decipher or use even the smallest scripts if they lack quality
documentation and interactive interfaces. Although these methods worked they were an
incredible time sink and documentation became stale quickly.<p>Artemis was devised as a solution to this problem. We wanted a tool that allows developers to
create high-quality interfaces and documentation without forcing them to invest substantial time,
alter their codebases or make significant changes to their workflows.<p>The way it works is simple: First add special comments to your codebase; Artemis uses these
comments (called “anchors”) to automatically generate a GUI for your code. Then run your
program using our command-line utility. Artemis launches in an offline browser window that
displays your code on one side and your new interface on the other. To see how this looks, you
can watch our demo video here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IDL12DkS2Hc"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IDL12DkS2Hc</a>.<p>This interface scrolls vertically, so as your code runs new GUI elements appear one below
another at the relevant time organized into “cards.” For example, if a program takes two
numbers and adds them, your interface will first show input fields for the variables in one card.
When you enter numbers and press “continue,” a new card showing the result will appear.<p>There are three types of anchors: inputs, outputs and documentation. Inputs let you change
variables in your program via the interface, outputs represent the products of your program as
graphs, text, etc. and documentation lets you create interface elements that explain what is
happening as your program runs. Documentation can take the form of text, Markdown, LaTeX,
syntax-highlighted code snippets, multimedia, and links, and more.<p>These anchors all follow the same format: you put them in a comment, beginning with “@,”
followed by its type— “input,” “output” or “doc.” For “doc” anchors you just proceed to add
whatever you would like to appear in the document card. For inputs and outputs, you need to
specify which variable they act upon by typing “data=x,” with x being your variable.<p>We provide a suite of default anchors, such as text inputs, and outputs in the form of text,
tables, and graphs—but we also let you create your own, using regular Python. Do you need to
create a custom anchor to quickly display your statistical data using Seaborn? Do you want to
automatically render advanced 3D plots in Matplotlib? Artemis makes this, and more, easy.<p>The reason we opted to have anchors work from comments is to avoid requiring you to alter
your code or the way you work. You don’t have to toggle between different environments—you
stay in your preferred IDE, bringing more functionality to it rather than requiring you to go
somewhere else.<p>For example, we subsume the functionality of Jupyter as a visualization tool without requiring
you to use a notebook. In our experience, notebooks are rather constraining relative to a full
Python environment— they require you to restructure your code for the notebook, run your
programs on an IPython kernel, and often import new third-party libraries or widgets. With
Artemis you get the interactivity of a notebook, as well as the display of UI elements and
documentation alongside code, but it also works with professional-grade codebases and tooling.<p>Artemis interfaces can be exported as an HTML file that runs offline. This is a key feature that
makes us a portable, effective documentation&#x2F;walkthrough tool. These interfaces are small
enough to send via email and can even be embedded in web pages. When a third party opens
your HTML file, they’ll see exactly what you see when you run your program with Artemis: an
interface on the left and your code on the right.<p>We thought the most obvious applications of this approach would be for quickly building
interactive computational tools and making test scaffolding for complex programs. But it turned
out to also be really good for making code walkthroughs that can explain your program to
coworkers or managers, or teach people how to use your program. You can see this in action here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V4c3Q6lHFPo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V4c3Q6lHFPo</a>.<p>Engineers at Mayo Clinic use Artemis in this way, using our Markdown, LaTeX, and multi-media
documentation capabilities coupled with custom anchor outputs to produce step-by-step
walkthroughs for their internal tools.<p>Artemis is ready to go, and we offer a free trial on our website. Setup and installation only take a
minute, but we’d also be delighted to answer your questions personally and&#x2F;or give you a
walkthrough—we like to meet our users!<p>Our current pricing model is $15&#x2F;month for basic Artemis. There’s a pro version that allows you
to create custom anchors (beyond inputs, outputs and doc), and export your interfaces as HTML
files. We also do the “contact us” enterprise thing for larger teams.<p>We’ll be around in the comments below and are super interested in whatever you have to say!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I just never learned it well<p>SO, with that all said, a quick way to explain GraphQL<p>It’s a technology created by a great team at Facebook that makes it more efficient for us folks on the front end to ask the backend for our data. Facebook the company blows but they do some cool stuff. This is one of those things<p>Let’s use an analogy to explain GraphQL and compare it to what USED to be the standard - Rest APIs.<p>With Rest APIs, we tell our backend team - “Hey, backend! 
Give us all of our users that have this ID” and the backend has to have already created something called an “endpoint” which is a simple URL you can plop into your browser and it shows you some data. For example: www.example.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;1 - if we go to this hypothetical endpoint, we expect that we will receive back ALL (SERIUOSLY - ALL OF THE data that the backend thinks is appropriate to hand us for that user.<p>That’s fine, but it’s a huge waste. Imagine if you wanted to ask your friend what her address was, but instead of her responding with her address, she’d write down her birthday, her phone number, all of the people she knows, her social security number, her password for her phone, and a whole bunch of other useless stuff. You just CARE about what her address, but she provided you with a bunch of information that wasn’t at ALL what you cared about.<p>The question becomes: How do we solve this with a URL the old way? Do we ask our backend to create a new “endpoint”? Something perhaps like www.example.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;1&#x2F;address?<p>That would work, but as we add more data to our user, our backend folks are going to have to create new endpoints for each one of the new pieces of data that we add, so we ignore this solution and instead just keep adding data to that first URL endpoint.<p>This is the problem GraphQL solves.<p>The frontend TELLS GraphQL what data we want about the user and it responds with only that data. The wastes WAY less bandwidth from the front end to the back end, speeds up our queries, and makes the code that provides data way more flexible.<p>Probably a little more technical information than is warranted here, but the request ends up looking like below instead of some convoluted URL like www.example.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;1&#x2F;address<p>user {
  address
}<p>and that’s it! The backend will now respond ONLY with the data we want, which makes our responses much quicker and faster and that’s good for all parties involved, including our end users.<p>Thanks for your question! Hopefully this helps you understand and please feel free to always ask questions. The more our PM folks know about the technology, the better!
