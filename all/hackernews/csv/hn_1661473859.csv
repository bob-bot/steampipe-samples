32601699,Software Engineer's life became weird after providing feedback at DoorDash,2022-08-26T00:08:30Z,vlad,1,false,false,1,[32601705],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Leading up to the past two weeks<p>I worked at DoorDash as a Software Engineer for over 9 months during the pandemic. When it came time to my first performance review in early 2021, spanning an 8 month period, weird things started happening after I left constructive feedback for my coworker. My last day at DoorDash was in March 2021.<p>Furthermore, even a long time after I no longer worked there, my Mountain View and San Francisco residences have been harassed by &quot;door&quot; related incidents.<p>Between December 2021 and until March 2022, when I started my next job, folks were unlocking the car doors about five times, opening the storage doors about five times, stealing a license plate, drawing green paint on the side of a car, and putting a 5 inch screw into my tire.<p>In early December 2021, I visited and enjoyed a BTS concert, including front row. It was an amazing experience and I was clearly very happy dancing along with some of the members. When I flew back, the entry doors in both San Francisco and Mountain View residences both scraped loudly when opened.<p>Quickly summarizing my DoorDash experience in a factual way<p>1) I felt I had completed, proposed, and led many projects across both Consumer and Merchant codebases when I worked there between May 2020 through March 2021. My salary level was 5 (lowest senior), and I was working on projects with my manager to attain level 6.<p>2) But I was given a PIP, and then during the first meeting where I was told I did well, I was given my 2021 performance review in the last few minutes.<p>3) The performance review from my manager did not cover the 8-month timespan nor the major contributions since I joined. It covered one small project my manager asked me to work on end of 2020.<p>I decided not to pursue arbitration back in March 2021 because of the following weird events during my performance review:<p>1) The week prior to my last day, someone left a roll of bills at my garage door.<p>2) The day I got let go, a pink sticky note was put in front of the garage door.<p>3) There was a small dead bird on the roof, and a large crow kept flying around.<p>But then, harassment started again in December 2021 and escalated this summer, on July 2022, even as I got a new job in March 2022. Therefore, it made sense to contact DoorDash to get closure on what happened. Maybe there was a severance offer or similar that didn&#x27;t reach me back then, so it was worth taking a few minutes to write an email.<p>These events were as follows:<p>1) In July 2022, cars on different occasions started revving engines loudly for 30 seconds when I arrived or left the Mountain View residence.<p>2) Someone drew an X with chalk in front of the Mountain View residence door.<p>In this email to DoorDash, I didn&#x27;t mention any harassment. I just wanted to get closure and learn why I was let go during the PIP, and asked if the severance option they quoted verbally (6 weeks) still applied.<p>I also pointed out that:<p>1) After my last day, DoorDash switched everyone to quarterly vesting. That means my 9 months of service, with just regular performance, was worth $500k at the then-stock price because my experience had covered May &#x27;20, Aug &#x27;20, Nov &#x27;20, and Feb &#x27;21.<p>(Math: $430k 4-year stock grant, divide by 4, multiply by 3&#x2F;4, then multiply by 5-6x post-IPO, is about $500k, or $2 million after 4 years. No base salary or bonus).<p>2) In 2022, DoorDash re-adjusted stock options upwards for other engineers since my employment, after the stock dropped. I was just asking for the partial value, not more value.<p>(continued below)<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;BL2Qngz<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;J7BhXMx<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;M6tThbs<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;y8hB3DJ<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;qB66qbR<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;dBFXPSx<p>Also https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;software-engineers-life-became-weird-after-providing-feedback",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
