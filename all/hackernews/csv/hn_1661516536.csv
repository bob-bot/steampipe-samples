I&#x27;ve written some opensource projects but they&#x27;re not popular... only 10-20 stars, one or two bug reports in a year. I&#x27;ve made contributions to large OSS projects but I feel like small fish in large ocean there. There are much bigger fish and whales in OSS who understand the codebase so well and they can extend that code and help others in ways I can only dream of.
For sometime I&#x27;m having an itch to learn some open source codebase really really well, go deep into it. I want the satisfaction of knowing one open source project deeply. But this takes time and focus. I get such satisfaction in my day job working on proprietary codebases. I want to find the same satisfaction in an OSS project. This could become my weekend hobby. I&#x27;m looking for suggestions. What I&#x27;m looking for:<p>* Very well established libre&#x2F;opensource project<p>* Something that will still be relevant and still be around after 20 years<p>* Something that has a community of users around it (it is okay if it is a niche community)<p>The &quot;still be around after 20 years&quot; is important because if I&#x27;m going to spend many weekends learning some codebase it&#x27;d better be on some codebase that is going to be around after 20 years so what I learn does not go entirely waste.

Headshot is a tiny side project I&#x27;ve been working on to create better looking profile photos.  It started when my wife needed a headshot for work.  Instead of just snapping a photo and calling it a day, we were looking for something a little more professional.<p>There are a ton of native apps that help you remove the background of an image, and after seeing the good work at remove.bg[1] I had a hunch even a script kiddie like myself could get a decent result using client side javascript with an off the shelf image segmentation model.<p>After a little research I found Google&#x27;s MediaPipe Selfie Segmentation[2].  It&#x27;s a derivative of the same tech driving Google Meet.  While it is performant on mobile phones, the tradeoff[3] is a less than pixel perfect mask.  It performs best when there is clear separation between the person and the background.  I went down the rabbit hole in this problem space and found this[4] and this[5] which led me to believe with a little more work I can get a better result.  I am completely out of my depth in ML and would most likely need a partner to help me implement better quality image segmentation for high definition photos.  I considered using remove.bg&#x27;s API but with the goal of keeping Headshot free, the unit economics won&#x27;t work for the time being.<p>Headshot is built with Vue and Tailwind and hosted on Firebase.  It leverages glfx.js[6] letting the user apply image filters to both the foreground and background. With a few filter tweaks you can put together a pretty decent looking profile photo.  I compress uploaded images as mobile browsers seem to fall over on raw files taken from an iPhone 13.  Final image compositing was pretty straightforward using HTML Canvas and the CanvasRenderingContext2D.globalCompositeOperation.  I do apply a bilateral filter[7] to the segmentation mask to smooth out the edges and provide an adjustable blur[8] on the background to create a light ring effect.<p>The quality of the result really comes down to the quality of the starting photo.  When I followed these general tips[9] for taking a good headshot I was able to create something that can pass as a reasonable headshot.  I am pretty happy with the result but would love to ultimately improve the segmentation mask under more challenging photographic conditions.  The lengths that the Google Meet team went to get a professional result are an interesting technical read[10] that is well above my pay grade.<p>I hope someone on Hacker News can use Headshot to create a great looking profile photo that they can upload to LinkedIn, Zoom, or Slack.<p>Happy to answer any questions.<p>Jason<p>[1] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.remove.bg&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.remove.bg&#x2F;</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.github.io&#x2F;mediapipe&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;selfie_segmentation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.github.io&#x2F;mediapipe&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;selfie_segmenta...</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1dCfozqknMa068vVsO2j_1FgZkW_e3VWv&#x2F;preview"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;1dCfozqknMa068vVsO2j_1FgZkW_...</a><p>[4] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anilsathyan7&#x2F;Portrait-Segmentation"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anilsathyan7&#x2F;Portrait-Segmentation</a><p>[5] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Volcomix&#x2F;virtual-background"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Volcomix&#x2F;virtual-background</a><p>[6] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;evanw.github.io&#x2F;glfx.js&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;evanw.github.io&#x2F;glfx.js&#x2F;</a><p>[7] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;m0ose&#x2F;imageRoutines"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;m0ose&#x2F;imageRoutines</a><p>[8] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flozz&#x2F;StackBlur"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flozz&#x2F;StackBlur</a><p>[9] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;headshot.page&#x2F;tips"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;headshot.page&#x2F;tips</a><p>[10] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.googleblog.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;background-features-in-google-meet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ai.googleblog.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;background-features-in-goo...</a>",story,https://headshot.page/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
