Like many here, I&#x27;m constantly working on side-projects and for the most part my interest in them fizzles out once I get past the interesting development part, or at least before completion (and the dreaded &quot;marketing&quot;).<p>This is one of the first projects in a long time where I&#x27;ve been excited to work on it daily and see it through to launch. And that&#x27;s mostly because it&#x27;s a project that I built primarily for myself. Sometimes the simplest and obvious advice that we overlook because it seems too easy to solve our own problems - actually works out - who woulda thought?<p>So on to the project itself - League Legacy is an application to track and manage your Fantasy Football League history. Anyone who plays in a home league or a league with buddies for several years like myself may like to track stats historically, league records, how you compare vs your friends, etc. In the past, I&#x27;ve tracked all this manually in excel and I&#x27;ve seen several examples here of others doing and sharing those sheets over time. It&#x27;s been a lot of fun, but well, excel is excel.<p>So I built a tool that does all of this for you and hopefully is a bit nicer than excel and is something I can continue to iterate on overtime and support more leagues&#x2F;sites and add additional features.<p>You can automatically import your league history from Yahoo or Sleeper, and also manually add season data from other sites that we don&#x27;t support yet, too. The site will handle displaying all your historical seasons, generate a record book for you, you can see member vs. member stats and matchups, you can even track your league finances through this tool if you&#x27;d like.<p>The goal is to (1) continue to fix as many bugs and support as many leagues&#x2F;variations as possible; (2) continue to build out the historical tools and stats; and (3) build out &#x27;in-season&#x27; league management tools and features through-out the season.<p>Anyways, would love to get some feedback and suggestions, and more importantly bug reports. This is an early tool, so undoubtedly there will be some bugs and issues - especially considering how much variation there may be in fantasy league setups, but if you just contact me I&#x27;ll work on fixing asap for your league.<p>If anyone is interested in checking this out and providing some helpful feedback, you can check out the demo or the full-site.
