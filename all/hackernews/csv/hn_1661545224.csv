Please don&#x27;t start saying only &quot;don&#x27;t do web development&quot; or &quot;university make you&quot;. TL:DR; at the end.<p>Schools in Italy are a disaster, they use bad practices -- I am obsessed with best practices -- and languages that I don&#x27;t like PHP (widely used in Italy), for the language design, crap salary and less jobs. So in my free time I try to learn to be a full stack developer (they -- the school -- learn you to become this) and the most part I hate is the front-end one, nothing wrong with HTML, CSS is easy but hard to master with it; and I lose interest in the back-end part, web frameworks, React, Ember, Vue [...], I know they made the work more easier, it&#x27;s not for me. What I like? I like developing, working with Software, Deep Learning &#x2F; ML, AI, Game Dev, Low Level Things, I use Linux, I like do things with Computers, Reverse engineering, break things and understand why, fix it; Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking, working with servers, network, sysadmin, use enterprise equipment and software (Java is popular on this), embedded, Simulation &#x2F; modeling (I have difficult in math), really interesting stuff. I&#x27;m asking some keyword in what can I start to learn at what I like and have a good life balance with money.<p>TL:DR: I can&#x27;t do university and I don&#x27;t like web development, instead I like working with computers, software, low level things.<p>FAQ:<p>So what’s stopping you from doing what you rather be doing? If you’re not in university, then you’re pretty much free to learn whatever is that you want to do.<p>Resource limitations. I have a Computer that has a Intel Celereon J4105, Integrated Graphics with 8GB Ram DDR4, so Major of things I like, I can&#x27;t do them. As far I know, be a Game Dev sucks since (what I read) is a underpaid job, also gaming lately follow a single business model, and I don&#x27;t like it. I am planning in a new PC but is suspended cause there is a lack of funds. So doing deep learning, Machine Learning, things that require (I THINK) newer hardware I can&#x27;t do them.<p>Try Cybersecurity&#x2F;Ethical hacking, your knowledge of Linux gives you a bit of a head start.
Cybersecurity &#x2F; Ethical hacking always interested me, I also bought Hacking, 2nd Edition, The Art of Exploitation and do something with that, but I stop thinking, &quot;I am losing time?&quot; or whatever.
