32613407,Ask HN: How can I “reset” the way I approach building software?,2022-08-26T22:20:52Z,mousebunny,2,false,false,3,[32613437],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve been out of school and working full-time at a well-regarded company doing full-stack Web Dev for 5 years now. But despite my career going well, I still feel like my approach to building software, both at work and for my personal projects, is not nearly as solid as I&#x27;d expect. In particular, I have a desire to write simple and straightforward software, but for whatever reason feel incapable of doing so, always making things way too complex.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve been working on a side-project for about a month now, and I feel like half of that time has been spent going back and forth and back and forth between different code design decisions.<p>First I wanted to implement an event-driven architecture, so I read articles and watched talks and landed on an event-sourcing style system, where I&#x27;d persist a log of all events that occurred in the app. I also incorporated DDD concepts like repos and domain objects, and persisted all app state in SQlite.<p>Then I realized that I was making things way too complicated for the first iteration of my little project, and tried to re-write it in a very plain and straightforward style, e.g. just using an ORM instead of a repo pattern, no event bus, keeping more ephemeral state in-memory; just objects talking to other objects.<p>But even after I completely re-implemented everything, I _still_ feel like I&#x27;m making things way too complicated, and am getting worried that maybe I&#x27;m just incapable, for whatever reason, of writing straightforward, simple software. When approaching a problem, I feel like my brain skips about 10 steps of simpler options before making a decision.<p>I&#x27;m looking for any advice or material that would help be get unstuck in my software building process and learn how to write _simple_ software.<p>EDIT: Specific ask: does anyone have any go-to examples of well-written, simple software? Either an actual open source repo, or a walkthrough-style article.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
