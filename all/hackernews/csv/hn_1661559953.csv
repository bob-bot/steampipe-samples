Been here for ~6 months. I have been in software for ~20 years and I literally have the skills of a CS college grad (maybe). I do not have a bachelors degree. I could not tell you how tcp&#x2F;ip works or create a linked list. I am very good at interviewing and a pretty good people &#x2F; project leader. People like me and I look after the people that work for me, always looking to speak well of them to leadership. I have steadily attained higher job positions. I keep each job for a couple years before jumping to a new one for a raise. To say I have imposter syndrome is a massive understatement. I am also really burned out, unable to focus for more than 30 minutes at a time and have been like this for years. I have somehow reached this position far outside of my skillset and a pretty good salary (not faang). I find myself really liking this current company and would like to stay here. How do I make myself a better engineer at this stage of the game? Essentially I need 1 more promotion to director level and then I don&#x27;t really have to worry about it, I can just do what I like which is manage people and projects. I am probably a couple years away from that. I never liked tech, I just kind of stumbled into it and stayed there because it pays well. I have managed to keep up with most of my work by working 60 - 70 hours a week a lot of the time and now I am fried. What should I do?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
