32618163,Ask HN: How can I come to peace with the years I wasted on pointless things?,2022-08-27T12:21:00Z,L0in,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I started listening the five hours (!) interview of John Carmack on Lex fridman&#x27;s podcast, and he was talking about, among other things, about the fact that he&#x27;s coding since he was a kid and spent hours upon hours in front of a screen and keyboard writing code. I find Carmack&#x27;s, Romero&#x27;s and the Id software folks work very fascinating and at some point i would like to dive more in depth on the history of their work and analyze their code to learn hopefully new things.<p>But that interview also strucked something that i&#x27;m battling with myself. I&#x27;m 23 and I spent my entire childhood wasting my time on Social media, World Of Warcraft, and other pointless stuff. Literally 10-14 hours a day. I don&#x27;t regret my gaming interests, but i do regret the fact that i wasted so much of my life on games like World of Warcraft (I started playing when i was 10 years old) instead of finding and developing my future interests and «passions». I&#x27;ve always knew i wanted to study Computer Science but due to my life circumstances(mental health problems, serious financial hardships, etc.)  i sacrificed a lot to get into university which i did and i hope i can finish it.<p>Over the last couple years i started thinking, how would my life be if i spent that time coding&#x2F;reverse engineering&#x2F;learning the internals of OS, reading books, or generally developing my interests instead of playing wow and mindlessly scrolling on SM? Would i still be in the same position in my life, the same person, as i am now? Honestly i can only guess but i don&#x27;t know how to handle that i lost so much viable time. Time which could had invested on my future and develop my skills as a computer scientist.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
