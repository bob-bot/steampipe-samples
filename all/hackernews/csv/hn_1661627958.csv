32622129,Ask HN: Apple MacBook M1 16gb or 32GB Windows Laptop?,2022-08-27T19:17:19Z,princevegeta89,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi all<p>Been stuck in this dilemma for a long time and wanted to get out there and make a decision on which way to go, once and for all<p>I&#x27;ve been an Apple hater for their predatory tactics and overpriced products and also because an unbearable extent of vendor-locking [like compatibility only with Apple products most of the time]. Add to that, I have also hated the general UX of Mac OsX but I&#x27;ve got to admit I got somewhat used to it because I&#x27;ve been using them at work for a long time. In fact, I believe some Linux distros have a better UX and customizability in general.
I&#x27;ve taken a look at Windows recently after a long long time and it seems like I can live with it. It&#x27;s the WSL&#x2F;Virtualization improvements that they made that impressed me.<p>I&#x27;m now at a stage where I&#x27;m looking to buy a machine but torn between these two. The Macbook Pro seems 400$ more expensive with only 16GB of Ram, however I&#x27;m considering it more because of the Asahi Project. I&#x27;m not sure how long it will take before it&#x27;s stable though. There are also other nice things like being quiet, cool, and having long battery life. The Windows laptop checks all boxes, is a touchscreen, and has 32GB RAM and a huge battery. I&#x27;m concerned about the RAM on the Macbook and 32GB is not something I want to afford at the moment. And I also see that Docker compatibility is a problem on M1 and it eats up the RAM pretty quickly. 
Windows on the other hand has a plenty 32GB and it should breeze through Docker because of WSL.<p>I wanted to get your opinions so as to weigh the tradeoffs better, and see which one would be a better choice for the next 4 years or so.<p>Sorry for the long post but will really really appreciate the help!<p>Thank you",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
