I chose this project because I wanted to learn Angular, while also developing something useful.<p>I have some prior backend experience. And, I was pleasantly surprised with how much you can achieve in the pure JS&#x2F;Typescript these days. For my app, the backend only sends the daily puzzle data in JSON, while the entire game logic and interactions are completely implemented in the frontend. I wrote around 4000 lines of the frontend code for this project.<p>For me, the best part was RxJS integration in Angular. It also had a fair amount of learning curve. However, once you have learned the basics, it saves a lot of redundant boilerplate code and makes the code more readable and clean.<p>You can play the game for free and there is no sign-up required:  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;10letters.app"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;10letters.app</a><p>The game does not save any user data at the server. All data is saved in the local storage. So, you can play the game again in the incognito mode, or after clearing your browser cache.<p>If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to add them in the comments.<p>Thanks!",story,https://10letters.app,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
