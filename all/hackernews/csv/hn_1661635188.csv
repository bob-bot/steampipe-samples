You know where everything is.
- Follow people or playlists, people can create some playlists with AWESOME content, you may benefit from it.
- We handle classic RSS feeds, but also Youtube channels, Twitter feeds, Spotify Podcasts, sub-reddits.
- An easy UI interface (This is still WIP, UI is very hard haha)
- Promote retention of information by allowing people to take notes (not highlighting but really take notes), instead of just consuming content and forget it. You&#x27;ll be able to find your notes easily.<p>A bit more about the project (you can skip this!), this is a side project that I&#x27;ve been working on for almost a year.
I&#x27;m a back-end developer and the stack runs in Python. If you&#x27;d like more details, please feel free to ask, I&#x27;ll be glad to answer !<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this, feel free to give any feedback, I would be really grateful :) !",story,https://symfoz.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
