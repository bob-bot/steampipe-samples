Been stuck in this dilemma for a long time and wanted to get out there and make a decision on which way to go, once and for all<p>I was a long-time Linux desktop user and now at the stage of moving to a different platform) I&#x27;ve been an Apple hater for their predatory tactics and overpriced macs (compared to Windows laptops in general) and also because an unbearable extent of vendor-locking [like compatibility only with Apple products most of the time, and having to use weird adapters to connect peripherals]. Adding to that, I have also never liked the general UX of Mac OsX. In fact, I believe some Linux distros have a better UX and customizability in general. I have to admit though, that I got somewhat used to Macs quite a bit from using them at work for a long time I&#x27;ve taken a look at Windows 10 recently after a long long time and it seems like I can live with it after taking WSL for a spin. It&#x27;s the WSL&#x2F;Virtualization improvements that they made that impressed me. I work a lot with Docker and also do Mobile development (React Native)<p>I&#x27;m torn between these two choices. The Macbook Pro seems 400$ more expensive with only 16GB of Ram, however I&#x27;m considering it for the excellent hardware, battery life, display and quietness. I am also somewhat betting on Asahi to be ready and it will be a dream come true to me. The Windows laptop is i7 12700H, checks all boxes, is a touchscreen with great display, and has 32GB RAM and a great battery life of 8 hours. I&#x27;m concerned about the RAM on the Macbook and 32GB is not something I want to afford at the moment. And I also see that Docker compatibility is a problem on M1 and it eats up the RAM pretty quickly. Windows on the other hand has a plenty 32GB and it should breeze through Docker because of WSL.<p>I wanted to get your opinions so as to weigh the tradeoffs better, and see which one would be a better choice for the next 4 years or so.<p>Sorry for the long post but will really really appreciate the help!<p>Thank you",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
