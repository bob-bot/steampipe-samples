For obvious reasons it&#x27;s not as simple as creating a GitHub repository, hence this post.<p>I&#x27;m not indifferent to arguments that these things could cause harm, but I believe that good-faith participation in the HN community is a sufficient bar for access to anything I could personally assemble, so what little (and hopefully growing) amount of this I get together I&#x27;m willing to share with anyone on HN who has even an eyeball-plausible comment history of caring about the community.<p>I don&#x27;t have much yet, but I&#x27;ve tracked down the torrents for e.g. GPT-4Chan and am starting to archive it&#x27;s tuning corpus, the HN comments corpus, some brand-name newspapers: low-hanging fruit like that. I&#x27;ve got some spare bandwidth on a modest number of GPUs so I&#x27;m planning to do a variety of fine-tuned checkpoints and throw together Docker and Nix environments for loading them up.<p>If you want what I&#x27;ve put together so far (which admittedly isn&#x27;t much) or to help with this: ben.reesman@gmail.com",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
