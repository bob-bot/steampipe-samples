There is not a single pdf reader that&#x27;s not shit. The firefox pdf reader is buffering ffs. This is the first time I&#x27;m seeing a browser buffering for turning a page of pdf in my laptop.<p>I need a pdf reader that does everything that firefox does, i.e tabbed, persists the page and tabs viewed in last boot. I&#x27;m not getting it. How can developers be so lazy or stupid? That they don&#x27;t even make a single competent pdf reader! And these are same devs who claim they&#x27;re the best in the world! WTF.<p>Fck it my badluck man.<p>And wtf is this scrolling in chromium browsers? Who tf is ok with it? How did nobody could make a browser that scrolled nicely? LOL! Tf. I tried imwheel setup, didn&#x27;t work. It needs to be built in the browser system itself, you can&#x27;t use extensions for like every second thing(And extension did no good in this case).<p>Firefox scrolling is great, but I need an alternate browser as well for my purpose(I use 2 browsers at once).<p>This is miserable. How can anyone enjoy such shit?<p>I&#x27;m literally crying rn. I can&#x27;t change stuffs now because I&#x27;m working for an urgent exam and I&#x27;d to be happy with this setup. But these 2 things fixed would make my life really beautiful.<p>I tried okular, mupdf, supdf...whatever the fck was available. Okular hogs memory and keeps causing (IDK what it is, everything gets closed, and linux gets locked. It&#x27;s not restart).<p>qpdfview was probably the bestest. But it doesn&#x27;t persists neither tabs nor pages.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
