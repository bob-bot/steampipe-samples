All the court cases I&#x27;ve seen around it seem to imply that it&#x27;s a violation of the CFAA to scrape data that is behind authentication.<p>However, Plaid seems to be doing just fine in this regard, as none of this banking data is publicly accessible. Sure, users are only accessing data that they would otherwise have access to, and Plaid is only facilitating this data transmission through scraping, however I am unable to find anything in the court cases that makes such a distinction.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m asking is &quot;is it legal for a service to scrape data behind an authentication wall if the user has granted permission for that service to access said data&quot;, and if it <i>is</i> illegal, &quot;how is Plaid operating within the confines of the law?&quot;<p>Obviously I&#x27;m not asking anyone to leave real legal advice, I&#x27;m only asking for people&#x27;s personal interpretations or theories.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
