32633994,Ask HN: What should I know returning to dev teams for the first time in 7 yrs?,2022-08-29T01:49:27Z,djellybeans,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"The first couple years of my career were relatively normal. Full-time software development work involving teams, not always local or in-house teams, but I had at least a couple of other engineers to work with. After 2015 work was sparse. I couldn&#x27;t catch a break most of the time with interviews and had to settle for solo freelance work to tide me over. It helps fill a few holes in unemployment, though.<p>However, I am always applying to full-time jobs, and want to know what to expect going back to work with a team of developers.<p>My past team experiences:<p>There was no unit testing and engineers weren&#x27;t really expected to own their testing. The philosophy in every workplace I&#x27;ve been was &quot;that&#x27;s what manual QA is for&quot;. I hear manual QA testing is on the decline- is this true?<p>Code commits are like throwing an update over a wall and let the lead developer worry about it. You submit a PR and lead reviews your code. No automated CI as far as I know.<p>In fact I don&#x27;t recall anything that was heavily automated. There was not a lot of big oversight with the dev process as everyone above senior or lead level was completely non-technical.<p>When off-shore devs were involved it was usually handled poorly. A miss in communication could mean losing a day of work because one overseas dev might accidentally un-do the merge by the time we step into work in the morning.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32633959,Ask HN: How can I do to land my first scrum master job?,2022-08-29T01:43:29Z,searchingForJob,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi,
I&#x27;ve been looking to land my first job as Junior Scrum Master  (is a Junior Master an oxymoron?) but I have been unlucky on my search.
I&#x27;m exposed to the day to day meetings from a dev perspective as my partner is a dev.
I did study Scrum master and then got a certification from scrum.org and they study and then pass without reading the test for SAFE dev (partner had to do it so I use the practice test as gauge bar), then pay for the SAFE scrum master course and pass the test again without reading.
I&#x27;ve been searching for a position using job boards like indeed, dice, and applying via staffing agencies for months (around 5) with no luck, not even a single email for a follow up interview.<p>As background I have a bachelor degree on psychology, and a master in logistics.
I migrated to USA so I have a job gap of 2 years, and before that on my country I did also have a gap of around 8 months after a layoff from a very big telco, I used to work in the logistics department.<p>How can I do to land my first scrum master job?
Any recommendations?
Email on my profile.
