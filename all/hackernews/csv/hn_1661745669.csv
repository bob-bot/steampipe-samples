However, I came across the new Apple Silicon M1 Chip and heard a lot of positive things about it. I wanted to purchase a device for my side projects so trying to get some insight on what your experience has been on this &quot;new&quot; platform.<p>My work heavily involves Docker, and I have always known that OSX never had a good support for it. I tried Docker for Mac on intel many many times in the past and it always was painfully slow and not of much use.<p>People who have experience with Docker, and software development on the new M1 platform, can you comment on differences compared to WSL2? I really liked my experience with WSL2 and it has always been a breeze to have a Linux machine live right in my Windows.<p>Thank you!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
