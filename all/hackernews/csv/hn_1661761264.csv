The idea is pretty simple: the company decides where to build a charging station for electric vehicles and anyone can contribute to installation costs for a fraction of it (e.g. Joe pays 5% of total, Hannah 2%, etc.). We take care of the installation process and routine maintenance and we get a small percentage of earnings, for instance 8%, while the remaining 92% is going to be split proportionally among the &quot;investors&quot; of the crowdfunding campaign (so Joe will get 5% and Hannah 2%). I&#x27;m planning to use only 150+ kW DC chargers (ideally, they should be 300 kW to be future-proof).<p>Do you know what&#x27;s the average margin per kWh of a charging station like that (it doesn&#x27;t matter in Europe or America, I&#x27;m ready to move if necessary)?<p>PS: Any tips or suggestions are welcome.<p>If you are wondering, that 8% doesn&#x27;t come from any calculation, it&#x27;s just to explain better how it would work.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
