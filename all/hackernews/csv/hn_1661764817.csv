  - On each keystroke, or perhaps every ~1s, that same content is synced to the Description field in appTwo.

  - Both appOne and appTwo could be browser tabs.
  
  - appOne could be a native app with appTwo being a browser tab, or vice versa. 
  
  - appOne could even be a game instance, with appTwo being a Notes application.
  
  - Think &quot;multi-cursor&quot; features in IDEs, but across apps, across processes.
</code></pre>
Platform notes:<p>Windows solution preferred, but if this kind of tech is even remotely possible, I&#x27;d be willing to switch platforms for times where this workflow would be a game changer.<p>Possible matches:<p>My gut tells me that tools like Synergy, Parsec, or AutoHotkey might have the right kind of DNA to make this happen, but in the end, I&#x27;m grasping at straws trying to figure out how focus states, keyboard events, or text content could be redirected like this.<p>Thank you!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
