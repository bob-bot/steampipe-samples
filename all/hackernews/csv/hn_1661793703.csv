But when I want to explore the map or plan a trip, I find it very clumsy and awkward to use.<p>I will preface this by saying that I have a really poor sense of direction, and that might be the cause of my frustration. Regardless, here are 2 examples:<p>Example 1: I want to know where city A is relative to a place I&#x27;m familiar with (city B or my house). I search for city A. The map zooms in on city A, which is fine. I then zoom out, trying to get a sense of where it is. But if it&#x27;s in another country or far away from me, I&#x27;d have to zoom way out to even hit a place I know. So I try to search for a 2nd place that I know, hoping it&#x27;d show both places in one view. But instead it does a crazy pan to city B, completely disorienting me.<p>Example 2: I want to visit 2 places in one trip (think FedEx and UPS). I don&#x27;t know their locations, but would like to make the shortest trip. I search for FedEx, and get maybe 5 results that are roughly the same distance from me. Then, I search for UPS, hoping to find one that&#x27;s close to one of the 5 FedEx locations. But as soon as I hit search, all previous results go away and I&#x27;m back at square one.<p>To be honest I&#x27;m not sure exactly what I&#x27;m looking for. Is there a map UI that&#x27;s significantly different from Google Maps that&#x27;s worth trying?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
