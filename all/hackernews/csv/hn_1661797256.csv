We built an MVP model which recognizes levels in which BTC is at the top or bottom of the cycle. It is primarily intended for investors who are not financially sophisticated as a possible help to protect their investment.<p>A short story about the creation of the product:
A few of us, friends and ourselves, have always been maddened by the regular loss of the largest part of unrealized profit during bear markets which tend to be very hard on retail investors.On the other hand, a lot of friends blindly invested into bitcoin at ridiculous price levels based on hypes, bad instagram and YouTube influencers and mouth of word.<p>We think that a large part of BTC and crypto investors live in a similar situation.<p>With this goal, we teamed up with experts in the field of data science and finance, and created an algorithm that gives the BTC price score based on crucial market parameters. This score shows excellent results in real time and on backtesting. Our ultimate goal is to create a platform with various features, which will help retail investors to better navigate through the market, and to protect them from large losses.<p>Therefore, we assumed that our USP has its audience among people who invest in BTC, and who had similar experiences in the bear market as we did. With the help of a landing page and paid Ads we want to test if a product market fit is possible with such a service.<p>Unfortunately this turned out harder than we though.
The problem lies in the fact the most popular social networks, among them Twitter as well, have problems with crypto advertisements. Although by definition we do not provide any financial product or services, not even financial advice, it may be that our service is interpreted that way and that we belong to a group where the space for marketing on social platforms is limited, rightly or wrongly. And we don’t know if we can change or adjust it at all, which drastically slows down our strategy of defining the product market fit.<p>With that, we ask for feedback or advises to the following questions:
-What do you think of our product? And do you think it is an idea that could be useful for BTC investors? If you don’t think so, how would you change&#x2F;improve the product?
-Is our product, like it is now, considered as financial advice? And is there anyway we can differentiate this kind of product from such a label?
-How would you implement the product market fit strategy of our product in the fastest and most favorable way, if you could not publish advertisements on social networks?<p>We are very grateful for any constructive advice or idea! You can find out more on our landing page (link above). Thank you!<p>Best regards,

USB-C shows a lot of promise in unifying all cables but was forced into devices before it was ready, and 6 years have passed. That&#x27;s what I classify the resulting mess as &quot;tech debt&quot; rather than just &quot;early tech.&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t assume anything is WAI.<p>- No dock works reliably, even expensive ones. Got KPs even from my CalDigit TB3.<p>- USB-C monitors are rare and often don&#x27;t work reliably.<p>- Dongles don&#x27;t work reliably, especially video-related ones.<p>- USB-C cables themselves differ in unexpected ways.<p>- Many MacBook models overheat if you charge on the left-hand side (supposedly fixed now, but now RHS charging is my habit).<p>Anything with -C on both ends is extra prone to issues. Even USB-C mice&#x2F;KBs can be picky about what cable is used. Ironically, adapting -C to USB-A to -C is more reliable than just using a -C cable.<p>Only buy USB-A peripherals unless you need a feature of USB-C. Besides the unreliability, you&#x27;ll run out of -C ports. C&#x2F;A adapters are cheap. -A hubs are dirt cheap. Getting more -C ports isn&#x27;t, and they&#x27;ll come with surprise limitations. People blame -A momentum for device manufacturers not adopting -C, but -C doesn&#x27;t make sense even by itself given how rare, dodgy, and expensive a multi-USB-C hub is. They didn&#x27;t exist at all the first few years.<p>My personal laptop is a 2015 MBP before all this, and maybe some day they&#x27;ll fix USB-C. Until then, it&#x27;s a more convenient way to charge a phone, or a good multi-port if you research and buy exactly the right peripherals.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
