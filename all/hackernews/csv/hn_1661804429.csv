Debt servicers provide loans based on the return and risk. They can use that data to make other investments, purchases etc.<p>A bunch of investments were made thinking that there would be $X coming in each month. Instead, $0 was being coming in each month. The difference is radical. Expected vs actual risk is -Infinite%.<p>So those investments are now at risk of failing. Which causes knock-on failures on other investments.

Is famous among zoologists because when the jellyfish is about to die can regrow as polyp inside the dying animal without changing its genome (is the same individual) and became young again like a Phoenix. This cycle can happen an unlimited number of times so, in absence of predators or accidents, the animal in theory can live forever. Is the most famous in the very exclusive and very reduced club of immortal animals.<p>The study of the genes related can help us to understand the longevity of the animals and maybe to improve our own longevity.
