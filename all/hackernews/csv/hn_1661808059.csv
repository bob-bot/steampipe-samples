It&#x27;s like a hobby in my free time.<p>My success rate has been pretty much 100%, some registrars like Porkbun get the domains delisted within minutes, I am very impressed.

aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHBsZXBheS5hdXRoLWljbG91ZC5jb20v (WARNING SCAM WEBSITE!)<p>They are both very well made and cloned in the style of official Apple websites.<p>The registrar seems to be ALIBABA.COM SINGAPORE E-COMMERCE PRIVATE LIMITED.<p>When I contacted their abuse email, I get an automated message saying my message is ignored because they get a lot of false reports (how convenient!), and redirecting me to another website[0] to report it which requires tons of your personal details, photographic evidence, and all sorts of nonsense. I filled out these forms but they seem to just ignore the report anyway.<p>For some reason these websites are still not flagged by Chrome&#x27;s Safe Browsing despite me making reports[1] and the website running for at least a month, having been registered on 2022-08-03. Google are normally pretty good in flagging these kind of websites but in this instance it seems futile.<p>Any ideas?<p>[0]
