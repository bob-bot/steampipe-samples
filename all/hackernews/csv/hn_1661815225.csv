The freelance market is saturated with millions of creators who are willing to work for dirt, driving down the value of quality work and quality clientele. And no, I’m not saying this to discourage those creatives that are just starting. I’m only emphasizing that creatives are in demand for a reason! 
If we’re in a hot market, then why aren’t we driving the price? Why are we settling for less. Why are we giving away $1 for every 5 dollars we make? Have you actually considered how the market takes advantage of us when they need US?<p>My goal isn’t to start a rebellion. My goal is to acknowledge that I recognize the value in a creator. I recognize the value in being a freelancer and being an independent. I want you to recognize that too. Creation is an art. Whether it’s photography or animations. Graphic designs or full stack development. This world can’t run without us.<p>I’m creating a community for creators. A true platform to establish independence. Charge what you want. Get paid ON TIME.
