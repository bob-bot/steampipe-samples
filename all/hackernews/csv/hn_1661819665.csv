32645201,Ask HN: Ok to only allow Google/Apple/FB login for mobile app?,2022-08-30T00:16:34Z,wheresmycraisin,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;m working on a food ordering app. My question is two parts:<p>1) In 2022, can I offer only social login with Google&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Facebook? (In other words, no traditional username&#x2F;password based authentication.)<p>My reasoning: 
a) The app is US-focused and users very likely have Google or Apple accounts. (Maybe I can add a few other providers for tourists&#x2F;etc.)
b) Having to think of a password for yet-another app adds friction to adoption. 
c) Password managers may or may not work in an app. 
d) Implementing password auth (as well as registration, password-reset&#x2F;etc) is not trivial. 
e) And, obviously, password authentication have many well documented problems.<p>2) Do I need to authenticate users at all?<p>When my user places an order, they will go through a secure payment-portal-hosted iframe from Stripe or similar payment processor. It doesn&#x27;t seem necessary to have them authenticated through our own system as well.<p>Having users authenticated to our system would be better for analytics&#x2F;tracking, but it seems regular tracking technology based on cookies&#x2F;etc would be a close approximation.<p>More about my app:<p>The main workflow is typical: you open the app, search for deals and you order through the app. It is being developed as a hybrid-web application using Ionic (I know ionic isn&#x27;t the most popular choice but I don&#x27;t have too much choice, so please forgive me), so it can be used both as an app from the App Store or as a regular web app.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
