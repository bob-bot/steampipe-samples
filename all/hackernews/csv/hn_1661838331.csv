32646918,Note taking software like Joplin but with different UI?,2022-08-30T05:26:53Z,shivajikobardan,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;m trying to find a app for Ubuntu that has exactly same features as Joplin but different colors,  and different UI. Because ik it&#x27;s stupid to tell, but I&#x27;m getting negative vibes and it&#x27;s not matching my energy when I use joplin but I love the joplin because it does everything that I want.
Important features for me are:
1) Paste image (embed it so that you can see it instantly, wysiwyg)
2) Have multiple tabs support (vertical bar or horizontal bar doesn&#x27;t matter).
3) Increase font by zooming with pinch touchpad movement. Or just have better font size choices.
4) Scrolling with mouse or touchpad should be smooth. (It&#x27;s not smooth in trilium notes).<p>That&#x27;s all I want, and I&#x27;m quite surprised it&#x27;s so tough to find an app that does both in laptop. 
I tried zim which is probably most close to these features, but it weirdly changes the position of tabs when you click on it, it&#x27;s annoying.<p>I&#x27;m using trillium notes but increasing font size isn&#x27;t very possible here. There&#x27;s a &quot;pseudo-fix&quot; to it, but it&#x27;s lame.  There&#x27;s not even a font size choice in trilium notes.<p>So, can you suggest me any apps in ubuntu laptop?<p>I&#x27;ve tried all apps present in Ubunutu Software app.<p>![image|182x137](upload:&#x2F;&#x2F;dcapJoatzDOT9cejKGpARf5d3R2.png)<p>I&#x27;ve also asked it here in hackernews!<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32606983<p>But I can&#x27;t use obsidian because it creates new tab(or new sth) for every pasted image. Sometimes, my notes are just images pasted with some texts in between, and it creates  a havoc in obsidian. I&#x27;m not sure if that can be fixed in obsidian and I really don&#x27;t understand the purpose of it.<p>I&#x27;ve read most askubuntu answers and still not satisfied with most. And yes, I&#x27;ve tried every apps that are present in ubuntu software store(that comes pre-installed with ubuntu by searching &quot;note&quot; and I downloaded every note application).<p>I don&#x27;t need any encryption, syncing, backup, any thing at all except what I mentioned above. Because I don&#x27;t write notes and study from laptop, I don&#x27;t get anything that I write in laptop. What I instead do is to collect every information that I collect from various sources in 1 notes (or more than 1 as a chapter has various topics) and instantly within 2-3 hrs, I write everything back to my paper. I don&#x27;t even need to save those notes.<p>Notepadd++ was doing great job except it could not add images. :(<p>I just tried typora, it&#x27;s great but doesn&#x27;t support tabs. Tell me if it does support it or if there is a way to make it  support tabs.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
