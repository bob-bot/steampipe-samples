In return, content creators earn a share of the revenue (+ we take care of pretty much everything customer, sales and technology related for them).<p>Effectively, this is a &quot;one subscription that works everywhere&quot; value proposition for consumers, using collective bargaining power to keep the price reasonable.<p>The dream is to replace the de facto ads-based revenue model (with its dependency on tracking and privacy-invasion) with a sustainable privacy- and user-friendly revenue model that does not involve any dependencies on user tracking.<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts!<p>You’ll find some live demos at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adless.net&#x2F;get-started"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adless.net&#x2F;get-started</a>.<p>--------------------------------------------------------<p>Are you a content creator? Feel free to give Adless a try! The networks are currently (very) small, but we are working on bootstrapping them so any help in this area is much appreciated<p>It doesn’t matter if you made a blog, a game, a SaaS or something entirely different. The aim is to eventually cover all these customer types and more so we would love to have you onboard if you want to offer your content without display advertisement or provide access to otherwise-paid content (full eligibility criteria available when signing up as an earner). We compensate based on time spend on content so no need to be clever about triggering page view events.",story,https://adless.net,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
