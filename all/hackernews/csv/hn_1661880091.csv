Hope it&#x27;s not considered spammy!<p>I and a collaborator who writes sci-fi just released the short story &quot;The Great Filter Button&quot; - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storiesby.ai&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-great-filter-button<p>Here&#x27;s why it&#x27;s relevant to HN: most of the text for it was generated by GPT-3 (with human curation, using SudoWrite) and it was entirely illustrated using DALL-E 2 and MidJourney, and a bit of DreamStudio aka Stable Diffusion (of course with human selection of prompts) AND it narrated using neural voice synthesis (via BeyondWords). And I think it came out very well!<p>To my mind it is a pretty good example of how the newest commercial tools by powered by learned media synthesis models can be leveraged by humans to make art. It also shows some of the limits: DALLE-2, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion all have trouble with more complex prompts and don&#x27;t follow various aspects of them, the voice synthesis is still pretty robot-y, and the GPT-3 written parts are heavily guided by human text (and the whole story is quite short).<p>We plan to keep exploring these realm of human-AI creative collaboration by releasing weekly short stories with this newsletter, and would love feedback, suggestions, or even entire submissions of your own creative work done using AI. Feel free to just comment here on HN, email us at contact@storiesby.ai, or comment here - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;storiesby.ai&#x2F;p&#x2F;submit-your-stories-ideas<p>Last thought: even with AI doing the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; of writing and illustration, a great deal of creative decision making is still left up to us with respect to subject matter, style, formatting, etc. I hypothesize that sturgeon&#x27;s law will remain true in the age of AI-generated text&#x2F;images (most of everything will be crap), and the job of literary agents, producers, etc. will just become far more involved. Sort of like A24 is mostly a distributor (and to some extent producer) yet have made a huge name for themselves - this may become the norm.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
