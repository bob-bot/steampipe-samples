Essentially, my son(diagnosed with Autism) suffers from ADD. This has hampered his executive function long enough such that he needs constant reminders to log in to class without incurring penalties for tardiness, needs constant supervision for Homework. There have been instances where he forgot to log in to his designated private lesson and we had to forfeit the class all-together. But once he receives the prompt and he is able to &quot;initiate&quot; the task, he is able to focus long enough. But, now that he attends a &quot;Full-time&quot; online high school(remind you NOT a homeschool), he needs to have 100% attendance and cannot miss or be late to login to his class.<p>I do want to preface it by saying that our son was diagnosed early on in his life and has had intense therapy for OT and social skills(there has been minor improvements), but being in high-school now the real life skills are lacking. I am looking for tools&#x2F;processes to improve his executive functions. Perhaps a reminder system, iphone based alerts(he does wear an apple watch) or some kind of visual aids. Anything free or paid(Apps&#x2F;offline paper based systems) is fair game here. Time is of the essence and I thank you if you read this far.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Well, a few short months ago I finally got a well-paying job! I&#x27;m not sure what or why or how, but it flipped a switch in my brain.<p>I think I&#x27;ve been gaslighting myself for years, telling myself I enjoy coding, forcing myself to spend my weekends and evenings doing it in the hopes that one day I&#x27;d be able to leverage that skill to advance my economic position. And so I did. I&#x27;m good at it. I don&#x27;t have any specific complaints about my job or my team. But now that I&#x27;m finally here I don&#x27;t feel happy like I thought I would. I&#x27;ve learned that I don&#x27;t enjoy the process of software development. I don&#x27;t enjoy writing code. I enjoy <i>creating</i> things, with writing the code being an essential but miserable part of that, and I&#x27;m not doing any creating now.<p>I don&#x27;t like sitting and looking at a screen for 9 hours a day. I work from home and while I love that, I&#x27;m <i>constantly</i> getting up from my desk because I just feel so restless. I go to the gym but it isn&#x27;t enough.<p>Moreover, and I hate to even admit this, I hate having to always be &quot;on&quot;. I miss having an easy job where I could be essentially brain-dead. Every day I come and have to solve problems, but not the fun puzzles I was promised, not the execution of novel ideas or the creation or real value. Instead I dig through legacy code that was written in &quot;start up&quot; mode and have to figure out what Bob&#x27;s function does that&#x27;s abstracted 20 layers deep. I have to dig through an api&#x27;s docs only to learn that a JSON key had the wrong capitalization in my request body. Ad infinitum. I could deal with constantly being &quot;on&quot; if it meant really solving interesting problems or creating something new and valuable. Instead I&#x27;m pouring my time and energy into what feels like categorically petty issues.<p>A big part of me wants to just quit and get a job where I can turn my brain off for 9 hours and then spend my free time dedicating my brain power to personal projects and actually build things. I&#x27;ve stopped all personal projects because after 9 hours at work, the last thing I want to do is sit in that chair for another second.<p>I&#x27;m making this post hoping to get answers to a few questions:<p>1. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Am I crazy?<p>2. What can I do to fix it? Has anyone experienced this, and then overcome it?<p>3. Are there any fields that are programming-adjacent where I could leverage what I&#x27;ve taught myself the past several years?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32653044,Ask HN: When to release the first version of an iOS app?,2022-08-30T17:45:50Z,spike021,2,false,false,1,[32653158],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve been working on an iPhone app for the first time while taking some time off between jobs.<p>It works fairly well, with the occasional bug or two. While it&#x27;s a simple app, there&#x27;s definitely a niche market for it and I&#x27;ve seen some interest for it.<p>The base functionality works well almost all the time, performance is decent (use of SwiftUI notwithstanding).<p>I&#x27;m finally starting a new job soon and my original goal was to release a v1 at that point.<p>The problem is I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m at the right stage with the app for it to be in a production-ready state.<p>It&#x27;s missing one core feature, although it&#x27;s not necessary for the main use of the app. There are a couple other bugs I wouldn&#x27;t mind debugging.<p>I&#x27;ve had some friends test it out using TestFlight distributions, so I have had some feedback that way.<p>So my dilemma is: should I release it now and try to do iterative releases the first couple months, knowing it could be busy while I ramp-up to my new job, or just... wait a while longer, hope for some solid free after-hours time when I&#x27;ll feel like hacking on my own project, and release a first version later at some point?<p>The one other side-note is it&#x27;s too simple of an app for ads and I was initially thinking I&#x27;d charge a small amount for it. Maybe USD1.99 or similar. But I feel guilty publishing it for that price if I personally don&#x27;t see it as &quot;perfectly ready&quot;, so then I wonder if I should release it as a free app for now and then charge for it later once I have more bugfixes and a new feature or two.<p>Any advice would be appreciated! I&#x27;m not really looking specifically for advice on ads-based freeware &#x2F; charging for the app &#x2F; free other than how they are affected with the state of the app at this time.<p>Thanks.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
