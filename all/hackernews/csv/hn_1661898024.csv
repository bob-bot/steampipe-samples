Not sure of the timescales but if this isn&#x27;t starting to really take off in 10 years I&#x27;d be suprised. Obviously one solution is to move up the stack and get better at guiding the AI, writing the specifications, data models or whatever inputs might be required by this, as yet, hypothetical AI system. High level systems thinking and mapping that to the messy problem domain will become more of a focus as the lower level detail wlll be increasingly automatable.<p>What skills, other than this higher level work do we see sticking around? Understanding security and infra generally, i.e. moving down the stack for an app developer also seems like a good option. As well as reasoning about the software behaviour we need to ensure security, reliability at a human level to some degree. It just seems like writing app code for many standard use cases will be a solved problem by some AI system so staying in the middle long term, might be a dead end?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32655591,Show HN: Givz – Let customers donate to charity while making more $$,2022-08-30T21:48:41Z,rpg3,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN,<p>We&#x27;ve all seen the age old discount incentive to make a purchase: Spend $75, get $5 off your order.<p>Givz provides online stores with a new way to drive sales: Offer customers a free donation to any charity of their choice post-purchase (i.e. Spend $75, get $5 towards any charity). This isn&#x27;t your old school &quot;Give 10% to this one charity&quot; or &quot;round up your purchase&quot; campaign. Givz lets customers search for and donate to most charities in the US.<p>This is a new kind of marketing and as a result, we&#x27;ve found that some consumers are more likely to be more motivated by it than they would be a traditional discount only campaign.<p>The real secret sauce is this: Not everyone redeems their offer to donate. Compared to a traditional discount campaign where you&#x27;re always spending the $5 to make the sale, with Givz, you&#x27;re only spending that when someone actually donates. This increases your sales while saving you money at the same time.<p>Does this replace all other forms of marketing? Definitely not. But it does give you an additional way to incentivize purchase, all while increasing your average order value.<p>The link attached to this post goes to our website where you can get a free trial. We have a turn-key Shopify app for Shopify stores, but if you aren&#x27;t on Shopify, we do have a link based platform that has had pretty good success for stores that can handle the integration and development work.<p>If you want to try out what the end-customer would see when making a donation, you can check out a test order confirmation page here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;merch.givz.com&#x2F;58620739737&#x2F;orders&#x2F;a5515d537ac45173126ee6aa8cd569d1?gz.preview=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;merch.givz.com&#x2F;58620739737&#x2F;orders&#x2F;a5515d537ac4517312...</a><p>tl;dr: Traditional discount campaigns (Spend $75, get $5 off your order) are becoming overused and less effective. Givz lets you offer donations to a charity of the customers choosing post-purchase, all while saving you money, increasing average order value, and potentially bringing in more returning customers who value giving back.",story,https://www.givz.com/how-it-works,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
