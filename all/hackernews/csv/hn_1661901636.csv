They haven&#x27;t updated the FAQs page yet, as far as I can tell.<p>&gt; Hi-<p>We’re improving the Terms of Service that apply to your Colab Pro or Colab Pro+ subscription making them easier for you to understand and improving the ways you can use Colab. The changes will take effect on September 29.<p>The [updated Terms of Service](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.google.com&#x2F;colaboratory&#x2F;tos_v3.html) include changes that will allow you to have more control over how and when you use Colab, allowing us to offer new services and features that will enhance your experience using Colab.<p>We will increase transparency by granting paid subscribers compute quota via compute units which will be visible in your Colab notebooks, allowing you to understand how much compute quota you have left. These compute units are granted monthly and will expire after 3 months. You will be entitled to a certain number of compute units based on your subscription level and will have the ability to purchase more compute units as needed.<p>Additionally, we will allow paid subscribers to exhaust their compute quota at a much higher rate. This will result in paid subscribers having more flexibility in accessing resources. Read more about these changes at our [FAQ](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.google.com&#x2F;colaboratory&#x2F;faq.html#compute-units).<p>If you would like to cancel your Colab Pro or Pro+ subscription, you can do that by going to pay.google.com and clicking Subscriptions and services. If you have any trouble canceling, you can email colab-billing@google.com for assistance.
