But I keep asking myself if I am doing enough.<p>4 years ago, I taught myself how to code and got started instantly, mostly contract jobs that turned out into big opportunities.<p>3 years ago in my first year of college at 17, in order to get more contracts, I created a software development agency and made websites for local businesses in my area.<p>1 year ago I transitioned from the agency business into my first marketplace company, an auction marketplace. I was losing money on small sales from payment processors and ads, as I had promised the users a 0% buyer&#x27;s premium. I was also the main seller, so I was selling at a loss when the auction closed. The business was closed at the beginning of this year.<p>This year, I transitioned from the auction marketplace, to create a market research app that&#x27;s based entirely on polls and the data we gather from people voting. Then I also got a job to keep funding these projects.<p>What should I be doing better to hit my goal in 10 years, I feel like I am on the right track but missing something else entirely.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
