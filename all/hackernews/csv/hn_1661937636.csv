I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s overwhelming for them to understand without the foundational knowledge.
My questions is this, every one of these platforms has age restrictions yet they knowingly have millions of accounts and data related to people they know are under whatever that age is.  
Why have we not just told any site collecting data on people they know who to be under said age needs to comply with something like COPPA?  Instead we&#x27;re satisfied that if they&#x27;re alerted they&#x27;ll delete the account.  If not alerted by any outside party they&#x27;ll just file it under the 8-13 year olds and market&#x2F;sell all that data including potential mental health related data??  It makes no sense that we&#x27;re not doing a good job keeping our younger generations data out of the hands of those who have no moral compass.
