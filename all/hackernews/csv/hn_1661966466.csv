32665325,Launch HN: Payload (YC S22) – Headless CMS for Developers,2022-08-31T17:14:58Z,sneek_,11,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN, my name is James and I founded Payload (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;payloadcms.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;payloadcms.com&#x2F;</a>) with two close colleagues, Dan and Elliot. We&#x27;re a dev-first headless CMS [1] that&#x27;s half app framework and half CMS. We&#x27;re closing the gap between the two.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re going to build a new SaaS app. Would you think of building it on a headless CMS? Probably not.  To devs, &quot;content management system&quot; is usually a swear word. If a team of engineers gets assigned a CMS project, it&#x27;s less than thrilling. Engineers want to avoid roadblocks, write code, and build things they&#x27;re proud of—but existing CMS get in the way of that left and right.<p>Rather, you&#x27;d build your backend on an app framework like Django, Laravel, etc—and for good reason. Ownership over the backend, better access control, customizable auth patterns, etc. Typically, headless CMS are super limiting; you&#x27;ll end up fighting the platform more than having it help. But, with app frameworks, you&#x27;re often left to roll your own admin UI, and that takes time. Not to mention building CRUD UI gets old quick after you do it a few times. That’s where a headless CMS could shine, because they instantly give you admin UI that non-technical teams can use to manage digital products. That saves a ton of UI dev time but without an extensible API, headless CMS are far too limiting.<p>Payload provides the best of both ends—a powerful and extensible API and a fully customizable admin UI out-of-the-box. All with a developer experience that we obsessed over.<p>Typical CMS’s squabble over winning the minds of marketers, but we know that marketing teams pretty much need table stakes when it comes to CMS. Log in, create a draft, preview the draft, publish the content. Go back and update some pages. Define editor roles and localize content. There&#x27;s no point in competing with that noisy market, so we&#x27;re undercutting it wholesale and treating developers as first-class citizens.<p>It uses your own Express server, so you can open up your own endpoints alongside of what Payload does, and you can extend just about every single thing that Payload does all in TypeScript. It&#x27;s MIT and open-source, fully self-hosted, comes with GraphQL and REST APIs, and completely customizable.<p>We realized the need for Payload while we were building the corporate website for Klarna. The Klarna engineers we were working with were among the best in the world, and while they evaluated headless CMS options, they saw restrictions in how all of the normal contenders &quot;black-box&quot; away the API. They wanted to build their CMS, deploy it on their own infrastructure, and truly &quot;own&quot; their CMS. They fell back to using WordPress. When that happened, Klarna inadvertently shined a spotlight on the CMS market and pointed out a significant void in proper code-based, developer-first CMS. There was no one to give them the DX they needed. So we built Payload.<p>Our business model is based on two things:<p>1. Enterprise features like SSO, audit logs, publication workflows, and translation workflows. Of course, as Payload is open-source, you can build these functions yourself, but enterprises are opting to pay for our official functionality and SLAs rather than rolling it themselves.<p>2. Cloud hosting. Now that Payload 1.0 is released and ready for production after more than two years of development and dogfooding, we&#x27;ve shifted focus to building a deployment platform for Payload that will deliver permanent file storage, database, API layer, and CI. It will be the easiest way to deploy Payload, but not mandatory to use—much like the NextJS and Vercel model.<p>You can get started in one line by running `npx create-payload-app` or you can try out our public demo at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.payloadcms.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.payloadcms.com</a>. The code for the demo is open source and available at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;payloadcms&#x2F;public-demo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;payloadcms&#x2F;public-demo</a>.<p>We would love to hear your feedback. If we don&#x27;t have something, we&#x27;ll build it. If there&#x27;s a sticky spot in the DX (developer experience!), we’ll fix it. Looking forward to hearing what you think—and thank you!<p>[1] Quick refresher: CMS stands for &quot;content management system&quot; and headless just means &quot;API-based&quot;, with no restrictions over where you use the content on the frontend.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The platform is currently in beta, but we’re independently launching this tool which you can use to generate language-idiomatic, statically-typed TS SDKs from any public OpenAPI schemas.  We hope to continue iterating on this to give devs a way to easily generate high fidelity client SDKs for all the major languages.<p>Inspiration for this product is from past experiences struggling with OpenAPI. I was originally optimistic about using the OpenAPI tools to build out our offering, but quickly realized that the tools left a lot to be desired, and would not have provided our end users with the developer experience we wanted.  While it’s not exhaustive, we’ve tried to address some of the biggest gaps in this tool:<p>* Low-dependency - To try and keep the SDK isomorphic (i.e. available both for Browsers and Node.JS servers), we wrap axios, but that’s it.This is intended to be idiomatic typescript; very similar to code a human would write; with the caveat that the typing is only as strict as the OpenAPI specification.<p>* Code just like a human would write - At this point static typing is everywhere. So wherever possible, we generate typed structures, construct path variables automatically, pass through query parameters, and expose strictly typed input &#x2F; output body types.<p>* Future direction - There’s value in being neutral, but we felt like there is more value in being opinionated. In the future we’ll add features like built-in Pagination, Retries (Backoff&#x2F;Jitter etc), Auth integrations, which should be handled in the SDK.<p>We’re planning to continue improving this service, so would love to hear what you think of the choices we’ve made, the issues we should address next, and what languages we should work on supporting.",story,https://easysdk.xyz/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Judging by the latest update from the ISW [1], Russia is still controlling a large swathe of the southeast of the country. It may very well be that the longer this war goes on for, the more likely the US &amp; NATO (who are providing materiel and logistical support to Ukraine) will gradually get more distracted and lose funding and interest. So it may be in Russia&#x27;s favor to have a multi-year campaign in Ukraine. But can they really sustain it? And are tactical nuclear weapons still on the table? With someone as crazy and power-hungry as Putin, I assume that, sadly, they still are.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.understandingwar.org&#x2F;backgrounder&#x2F;russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-30",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
