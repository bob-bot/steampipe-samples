My HS CS teacher was pretty smart in choosing to teach us through making video games in Python. Back then, coding was basically addictive - really one of the purest forms of creation.<p>After graduating HS, I found myself constantly reaching for that original graphics API - to build a custom visualization for some data or to make a dumb little video game as a weekend project. And I wanted to put it in a web browser to share with my friends via link.<p>So I rewrote the library for web&#x2F;javascript. The intention for the library isn&#x27;t to be something to build AAA games with, but rather be low-overhead and simple enough to learn for any web engineer to learn in minutes for a weekend project.<p>You can basically make any game by:<p>* Drawing Shapes&#x2F;Images<p>* Play Sounds<p>* Listen for Mouse&#x2F;Keyboard Presses<p>Want to get started? Check the README for the CodePen &amp; boilerplate CLI<p>Hope you make something fun :)<p>soft-boy",story,https://github.com/soft-boy/graphics.js,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
