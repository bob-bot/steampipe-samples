32669344,Ask HN: How to design database schema for usage based billing?,2022-08-31T22:48:16Z,punkpeye,6,false,false,1,[32669591],<null>,<null>,<null>,"The service I am building is usage-based, i.e.<p><pre><code>  * I am charging per second the service was used, e.g. USD 0.01&#x2F;second
  * I would like to give credits upon sign-up.
  * There is no monthly minimum.
</code></pre>
At the moment, I am thinking that I can achieve this with just a few tables:<p><pre><code>  * `billing_account (id, billing_rate, running_balance)`
  * `billing_rate (id, rate)`
  * `account_credit (id, timestamp, amount, function_execution_id)`
  * `account_debit (id, timestamp, amount, source [platform_credit or stripe])`
</code></pre>
When a user creates an account, I would create an entry in `billing_account` and associate whatever the current `billing_rate`. I would also create an `account_debit` entry with `source=platform_credit` and update `billing_account` `running_balance` value to reflect their balance after the `platform_credit`.<p>Then whenever they run a function that costs them, I create `account_credit` account with an entry equal to the amount they spent and update `billing_account` `running_balance` value.<p>When they top-up their account, I would just add entry to `account_debit` and update the balance again.<p>This appears to cover all my use cases, but I wanted to check with anyone who&#x27;s designed such database schemas before.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32669306,Ask HN: What will be the large-scale second-order consequence of AI Art?,2022-08-31T22:44:48Z,chenxi9649,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"The main use case that comes immediately to mind when using tools like Midjourney&#x2F;DALL-E&#x2F;Stable Diffusion is graphic design&#x2F;stock photos, and most of the discussion surrounds this theme of making art more efficient(like that SD Photoshop plugin). However, somehow, these discussions give me the feeling of predicting that the main purpose of an automobile is to deliver milk(the faster horse idea).<p>For example, Photography, something that was only accessible to a few, became massively accessible when the iPhone came out. The large-scale second order was not simply that we had more photos we could reminisce with(the previous major use case of photos). But rather that we started <i>sharing</i> photos&#x2F;videos with each other as a form of communication&#x2F;storytelling. (with platforms like IG&#x2F;Snapchat&#x2F;Youtube&#x2F;Tiktok)<p>This new generation of art tools fundamentally *expands* the set of people who can express their thoughts&#x2F;feelings <i>visually</i> from a tiny fraction of the population to the masses. Something that used to take years of training is now achievable with a few weeks of practice. This is INSANE! And it&#x27;s hard to know how this will <i>actually</i> change the world. <i>(Note: I am by no means saying amateur artist + AI == professional artist, just like how iPhone didn&#x27;t kill professional photographers.)</i><p>Will there be a new medium of storytelling? Will the next generation of Wattpad writers become &quot;comic book artists&quot;? Will we start to communicate through generated art that represents how we feel?
