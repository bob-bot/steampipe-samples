But sometimes big companies either build their own language(s) or back one of the open source language project. Some for strategic reasons, some because off-the-shelf languages do not meet their requirements, and some because their bread-and-butter relies on it. My understanding is following major companies have heavily invested in the below listed languages:<p>C++ (Microsoft and Facebook)<p>C#, F# (Microsoft)<p>Java (Oracle)<p>Rust (Amazon, Mozilla)<p>Go, Dart (Google)<p>Swift (Apple)<p>Any other major companies seriously backing programming language(s)?<p>The reason I am interested in this is because it gives some indication of whether the language will get serious traction long-term or will become an &quot;also ran&quot; language.<p>Languages that are used in the enterprise tend to survive longer. The ones that are used for consumer apps(e.g. Objective-C) or developed by companies for internal purpose tend to be expendable or get forgotten after initial hype.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I quickly realized how hard it was to live alone. I miss my old life a lot, my parents also miss me.<p>I don&#x27;t like spending time and energy on house chores, I hardly have any energy for my hobbies. Plus I have a lot of expenses.<p>I want to move back, my parents also want me to move back.<p>Before I moved out, I thought living with parents held me back. I wanted to cook, have room for my stuff, invite friends over etc. I did all of these things. Things weren&#x27;t perfect as I imagined. There was also a lot of peer pressure before I moved out and I had my first real GF so I needed privacy. Consequently I moved out, but I immediately regretted it.<p>I now might have an opportunity to get an old flat from a relative for relatively very cheap rent. The relative says that she planned on giving me the flat anyways and was surprised that I moved out (I am 26). Her long time tenant is moving out and the place will be empty soon. My parents tell me to get the flat move my stuff in and use the flat when I need privacy. I plan on living with my parents during the work week (I work remotely from home) and stay at my relative&#x27;s flat on Friday&#x2F;Saturday. I have a GF so I could really use the privacy. Plus I have a lot of musical instruments, computing hardware etc. that I cannot fit into my old room.<p>What would be your advice? Would it be too luxurious to rent a flat where I stay a couple of days? The rent would be 1&#x2F;2 the rate I am paying now  it would amount to 1&#x2F;12 of my monthly net salary.<p>If I get the flat I plan on living like this for at least 3-4 years or more until I get married. I do not want to move out on my own again.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
