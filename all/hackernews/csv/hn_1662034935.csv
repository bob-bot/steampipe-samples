32675053,Transible – your way to “Infrastructure as Code” with Ansible,2022-09-01T11:48:26Z,sshnaidm,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Cloud resources management might be tough for big companies, small companies that start their cloud journey, or companies without much SRE and DevOps expertise, or even with it. Although there is no way to avoid working with clouds today, it&#x27;s never easy and cost management and vendor lock remain the most complicated problems.
Transible - a tool that makes life easier, by running it you get all your resources organized in Ansible playbooks and tasks and ready for deployment.<p>Find out unused resources in your cloud that eats money and save your costs
Use Transible to discover all infrastructure resources you have and review if you need all of them. In case you discover unnecessary resources, just use the Transible code to delete them.<p>Start managing your cloud with infrastructure as code to adopt the best SRE and DevOps practices to prevent chaos and waste
Use playbooks generated by Transible for easier management and full automation of your cloud.<p>Automation of cloud provision
Use Transible which will generate an automated playbook for you at once, and since then all you need to do is just change the code there to maintain your infrastructure, automation is done!<p>Backup your infrastructure
Use Transible to generate the IaC code for you and you&#x27;ve got your backup for free!<p>Reproduce your infrastructure (for testing purposes for example)
Use Transible to generate a deployment code for you and just run it on a different environment to duplicate what you have.<p>How about to move your infrastructure to a different region, zone, or cloud provider?
Deploying to a different region or different cloud provider, like transferring resources from AWS to Azure, from Azure to Openstack is going to be much more challenging and this feature is currently under heavy development in Transible.<p>How to use Transible?
It&#x27;s just simple as it is:<p>git clone https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sshnaidm&#x2F;transible
# For AWS (make sure you have your credentials in ~&#x2F;.aws&#x2F;config) so far EC2 and VPC services are supported.
.&#x2F;transible.py --from aws --to ansible
# For Openstack (make sure you have your ~&#x2F;.config&#x2F;openstack&#x2F;clouds.yaml)
.&#x2F;transible.py --os-cloud my-cloud-name --from openstack --to ansible<p>And find your playbooks in a &#x27;aws_generated_playbooks&#x27; directory for AWS or &#x27;os_generated_playbooks&#x27; for Openstack. See the demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asciinema.org&#x2F;a&#x2F;Wsad95zocPJIMp4bJV0dnklaA<p>Please report any feature requests or bugs in Github repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sshnaidm&#x2F;transible&#x2F;issues
