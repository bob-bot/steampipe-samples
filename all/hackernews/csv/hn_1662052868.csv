The site also generates some plots of you data automatically, and if you have Amazon.com receipts in your inbox, stalkmyself.com will parse those, too, giving you a separate CSV and a cumulative spending chart. Among friends, this chart has been the crowd favorite to sweat over.<p>Backstory:<p>Stalkmyself.com started originally as a joke with friends about the most terrible startup concept I could come up with. The initial idea was using computer vision to stereotype public Instagram posts, and the first version of stalkmyself.com scraped your Instagram data for you via instagrapi [3] (sans computer vision, all stereotyping was the responsibility of the user). Though I got it working, I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable releasing a tool that might Instagram accounts banned for bot-like behavior, so I repurposed the site to run on data you can export yourself with first party tools (GMail data exported with Google Takeout).<p>Thoughts on Pyodide:<p>Because this is HN, I figure folks might appreciate thoughts on Pyodide from someone who used it to build a site. Overall, I had a lot of fun with Pyodide. As a data scientist by trade, Python is my bread-and-butter programming language, and being able to run it in the browser feels magical. Even complicated dependencies like numpy and matplotlib run smoothly, allowing for plotting and other complex operations. It&#x27;s certainly a huge sacrifice of page load time to run the Python interpreter in your website, and developing Python to run in the browser was more of a tightly-coupled experience than I had anticipated (I learned a lot more JavaScript than I wanted to with this project), but for another standalone app I would definitely use it again and recommend it to others!<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pyodide.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pyodide.org</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;takeout.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;takeout.google.com</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adw0rd.github.io&#x2F;instagrapi&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adw0rd.github.io&#x2F;instagrapi&#x2F;</a>",story,https://stalkmyself.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Please take action as appropriate for your organization.<p>We hear from you that you want the full richness of Microsoft Teams features on Linux such as background effects, reactions, gallery view, etc. We found the best way to act on this is to offer a Teams progressive web app (PWA) on Linux as a new feature of our current web client, which we’ll make available to our Linux customers in the coming months. PWA enables us to ship the latest Teams features faster to our Linux customers and helps us bridge the gaps that existed between the Teams desktop client on Linux and Windows. The PWA experience will be available on both Edge and Chrome browsers on Linux.<p>We will be retiring the Microsoft Teams desktop client on Linux in 90 days (early December), which is currently available in public preview. All users on the Microsoft Teams Linux desktop client will have to transition to the web or PWA version, which is where we will continue to invest our development resources. We are committed to helping all current customers on Linux start using the PWA app; we’ll publish guidance once we are closer to releasing this feature.<p>Teams PWA is an evolution of our Linux web experience - it offers the “best of the web with key functionalities of client”: zero-install, lightweight, and has a rich set of features. For example, the PWA version supports features such as:<p>Background blur and custom backgrounds
Reactions and raise hand in meetings
Large gallery and together mode
PWA also provides desktop-like app features such as:<p>System notifications for chat and channel
Dock icon with respective controls
Application auto-start
Easy access to system app permissions
When will this happen?<p>We plan to make Microsoft Teams PWA on Linux generally available in the coming months.<p>How will this affect me?<p>If your users&#x2F;administrators use the Microsoft Teams Linux desktop client, they either need to set up the Microsoft Teams PWA (when it is generally available) or use the Teams Linux web app to ensure business continuity.<p>What do you need to do to prepare?<p>To prepare, we recommend informing all your users about the upcoming changes, encouraging them to switch over to the PWA (when it is generally available) to get the latest features on Linux along with a desktop-like experience. Microsoft will publish a blog post about this change and how to install Teams as a PWA on Edge and Chrome once we are closer to making this feature generally available on Linux in the coming months.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Customers wanted to bring data into their source of truth without having to maintain custom built pipelines or introduce security risks by contracting a third-party ETL&#x2F;ELT provider.<p>After seeing Stripe <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;data-pipeline"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;data-pipeline</a> and customer.io <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;customer.io&#x2F;data-warehouse"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;customer.io&#x2F;data-warehouse</a> recently invest in building out their own native data sharing products, we realized that many SaaS companies could better support their customers and even generate additional revenue by offering native data pipelines.<p>Our goal with Pipebird is to make creating a reliable data pipeline as simple as pressing a button from a vendor&#x27;s dashboard.<p>With the current iteration of the product, data can be selected from a number of sources (ex: Postgres, MySQL, CockroachDB, etc.), customers can configure pipelines and optionally apply transformations (like type casting), and data can be periodically synced directly to customers’ warehouses (ex: Snowflake). We’re actively adding sources&#x2F;destinations and would appreciate any feature requests.<p>Here&#x27;s a 2 min demo of the product <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c7a7e4b4e57c4015b533fd754c510b2e"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;c7a7e4b4e57c4015b533fd754c510b2e</a><p>Pipebird is open source (MIT license) so that any developer can use it. Our aim is to not charge individual developers - we make money selling paid plans that include features like multiple projects, user permissions, additional security features, managed infra, support, etc.<p>Give us a whirl: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pipebird&#x2F;pipebird"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pipebird&#x2F;pipebird</a>.
