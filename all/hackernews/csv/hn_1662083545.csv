32685375,Show HN: I made an indie app store alternative with a twist,2022-09-02T00:59:04Z,kbst,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"The twist is that although it does (part of) the job of an app store, it&#x27;s not (nor aims to be) an app store.<p>It&#x27;s a script you add to your existing web app that makes it &quot;self-distributing&quot;. Check it out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;progressier.com.<p>Under the hood, it leverages the concept of &quot;PWA&quot;, but it goes further:<p>1. It creates an installation page for your app that looks like an app store listing. Demo example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;install.page&#x2F;covid<p>2. It handles every OS&#x2F;browser combination to create an installation flow that works everywhere (e.g. on Safari&#x2F;iOS, with in-app browsers, etc)<p>3. It lets you manage all the technical aspects of your PWA in a dashboard rather than in code (i.e. service worker, app manifest, caching strategies, icons, etc). You can even send push notifications and design app screenshots from Progressier.<p>Caveats:<p>- It only works for web apps<p>- It&#x27;s not free!<p>- An app store is supposed to handle &quot;logistics&quot; and &quot;promotion&quot;. Progressier only does the former. It won&#x27;t get you new users.<p>- Push notifications are not yet available on iOS<p>Some fun facts:<p>- There are 5,000+ apps using Progressier<p>- 50%+ of my customers are users of no-code platforms, particularly Bubble.<p>- Under the hood, Softr&#x27;s PWA Builder (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.softr.io&#x2F;pwa-builder) actually uses a white-labeled version of Progressier I provide them<p>- Progressier is built entirely by me (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kevin.tw).
