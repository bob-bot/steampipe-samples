When it comes into effect, the new phone will come with only basic apps like calling, messaging and gallery. Nowadays, many companies pre-install many apps with new phones. Most of these are self-updating and cannot be removed by the user. App developers also pay mobile manufacturers for this.<p>The new draft guidelines also stipulate that the user should be given a notice while collecting information over the phone. Consent must be sought when collecting personal information. The purpose of collecting the information and whether the data will be sent outside the country should also be specified.<p>∙ The phone&#x27;s security system should prevent downloading apps from other than authorized app stores. (Currently this is allowed)<p>∙ App stores like Google Play are fully responsible for the security of apps<p>∙App stores must have company registration in India. There should be nodal officer and grievance redressal mechanism.<p>∙ Developers also need Indian registration if the app is for Indian users. If the app is international, the user should use it at his own risk.<p>∙ Mobile cloud service for users in India must use servers in India.<p>∙ &#x27;Developer Mode&#x27;, which allows app developers to make significant changes to the phone software, will be available only on sample phones.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
