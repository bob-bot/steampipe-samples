I want to re-create a similar search index in the static version. Preferably in s self-contained way that doesn&#x27;t rely on external servers eg. Google, DDD, Algolia etc. as those APIs may change in future and I want to be able to freeze the site as it currently is, without having to revisit it over the coming years because stuff has broken.<p>Most of the &#x27;roll your own&#x27; search options out there seem to be overly complicated for what I need, as they&#x27;re designed to be used on sites where the content is changing and being added to. As this site is being frozen &#x27;as is&#x27;, I just basically need something that will index the current content and prepare some kind of index of titles&#x2F;keywords which can then be searched against.<p>Is anyone aware of anything that would fit the bill?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;m Brazilian and traveling through Europe now. I&#x27;m split between moving to Europe (Vienna, Budapest or Lisbon) or moving to the US (SF, NYC).<p>I&#x27;m starting a new company (AI space). I have seen a lot of disturbing news about SF, but as far as I understand there is still a lot of talent and capital in SV.
