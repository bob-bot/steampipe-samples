32695817,Ask HN: Burning out from people rather than overwork,2022-09-02T21:19:02Z,graypegg,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I’ve been working in development in some form for about 5 years, and I’ve been at my current job for about 1.5 years. It’s genuinely interesting product on the surface, and at some-point I know I was pretty excited about working here. All my I’ve had roles, including my current one, have all just been as individual contributors, so no stressful side hustles or anything, just working on teams.<p>I’ve noticed a real shift in my own outlook the past year or so. I’ve messed up on things at a pretty regular interval, and as tacky as it is, there’s pull request comments and reviews that have really stuck in my mind, and coloured how I see coworkers. We’re all remote, we speak during the usual scrum meetings, and that’s about it. It’s allowed me to fill in this really cynical view of them all, and I find myself just resenting them, while also feeling a bunch of guilt over tripping over missed A&#x2F;Cs in a PR or something. As well as my own gut tells me the code base we’re responsible for is too huge to be the responsibility of one team, I still find there’s entire areas of unfamiliarity that I run into, which just leaves the entire project feeling distant, if that makes sense.<p>The past month it feels like I’ve taken a bit of a nose dive, and started just being incredibly slow to do anything. I don’t know if I’ve felt this negative about my own job before, and it’s scared me a bit.<p>Maybe this is just me venting, but I’m curious if anyone here has felt this way before. Burnout not from people, rather than late overworked nights.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The information affected for each relevant customer may vary.<p>At Samsung, we value the trust our customers place in our products and services ‑ trust that we have built up over many years. By working with industry ‑ leading experts, we will further enhance the security of our systems ‑ and your personal information ‑ and work to maintain the trust you have put into the Samsung brand for more than 40 years.<p>We regret any inconvenience this may cause you and appreciate your trust in us.
