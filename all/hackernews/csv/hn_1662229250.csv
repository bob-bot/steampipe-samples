I&#x27;m Rhys, the developer of Answer Overflow - a site that is meant to improve &amp; index the help channels of Discord servers on the web.<p>The problem is that communities using Discord for their support don&#x27;t have any of their content indexed on the web, so when someone Googles a question that has been solved in that Discord server, it won&#x27;t appear in search results<p>The goal of Answer Overflow is to get all of that content indexed on the web, while also respecting the privacy of the people in the server and complying with the terms of service. It&#x27;s quick to setup and only takes about 5 minutes, and should work with however your community has it&#x27;s help channels setup already.<p>To publicly display messages, Discord&#x27;s ToS says that applications using their APIs require user consent so Answer Overflow has tools built out to drive getting user consent. Otherwise if they haven&#x27;t stated they want their messages to be public, then they can only be shown if the users share the server.<p>Along with displaying messages, Answer Overflow also works to improve the way that people ask questions by allowing them to mark their question as solved, so the members of your community know what questions need attention at a glance.<p>The goal of this project is to build powerful tools for communities on Discord to use to manage their help channels<p>Here&#x27;s an example of a result page coming up in Google: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=InventoryGUI+RedLib+errors+for+addButton"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=InventoryGUI+RedLib+errors+f...</a><p>Here&#x27;s a community page on Answer Overflow:
