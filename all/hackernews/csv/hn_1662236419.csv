For the past ~3 years I have been leading a small team (4&#x2F;5) of SDK engineers, and discovered a passion to lead and grow people. Mind you, I do see myself hands on, as solving problems is something very dear to me and I don&#x27;t see myself scaling that down in the near future. 
It&#x27;s worth mentioning that in addition to leading, I took seriously to having the &quot;decision making&quot; power to create new stuff by materializing some small scale distributed backend services, custom-big data pipelines and other outside-the-mobile-realm stuff.<p>Now I find myself at a cross road, having thought on where I see myself in 10 years, I came to conclusion that I might be roadblocked - If I would want to proceed to the CTO&#x2F;VP Eng. route, it would be less easy coming from the mobile realm, as statistically (nothing official or anything, just looked around me) most director level and above seem to grow from the backend&#x2F;fullstack realms.<p>I did take this topic up with my managers, who understood the issue and offered to help by finding a suitable engineering&#x2F;architecture role in any of the non-mobile engineering teams. Now it&#x27;s up to me to decide if doing such a move would benefit me or might hurt me.<p>Sorry for the long write up, hope someone might be able to help me here if he&#x2F;she were in similar positions, or have some useful advice.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Additionally, there is an alternate board layout with some new tile multipliers.<p>This is an old project but I never posted it, so I thought what the hey, I am curious to hear what your guys&#x27; thoughts are on these rules. It&#x27;s an old dead project so you can&#x27;t hurt my feelings. Thanks!<p>You can play it now against the computer in your browser (no signup required, but an account lets you create and play games against other humans). The Android app is the better version only because the AI will run on a seperate thread (in the browser version you might see a hiccup while it runs), and because Unity WebGL doesn&#x27;t export retina-sized graphics (ie graphics may look less than sharp on your mobile device).<p>(Note: I linked the landing page instead of the direct link to play in case you are on mobile and want to avoid a largish download. Direct link to play in the browser is here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crapple.mobi&#x2F;play"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crapple.mobi&#x2F;play</a>)<p>---<p>Some more details for anyone still reading...<p>It&#x27;s your basic LAMP stack on AWS, with Laravel for the web framework and Unity (2017) for the client.<p>The dictionary is stored as a DAWG.<p>When you play a word, instead of giving you the dictionary definition, I wanted to do something different like provide a paragraph from a book that the word was used in. You can click the book icon to get some of those, I was scraping books in the public domain but gave up after a while when I was getting diminishing returns for words I lacked paragraphs for (if you try it you will likely see a lot of Moby Dick paragraphs as I never randomized it either).<p>The AI was based on the scrabble AI algorithm (I think it was this, but can&#x27;t remember now, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0004370201001667?ref=pdf_download&amp;fr=RR-2&amp;rr=745118707b1e177c"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S000437020...</a>). Since Crapple has modified rules, due the possibility of &quot;buying&quot; vowels on your turn, there is set of _potential_ playable words. The Crapple AI ranks each word based on the cost of the vowels needed with their probability of obtaining the needed vowels.
The AI is not very intelligent, the difference between the 3 provided computer opponents is just the average word score they will play. If I had worked on this any longer I could have extended this to let them take into account what words&#x2F;scores they may be setting you up for with their play, and other ideas.<p>Each player&#x27;s avatar is consistent, but uniquely generated for them. I didn&#x27;t want to have every using the same boring default avatar, but didn&#x27;t want the hassles of letting people upload their own, so I went with a version of this idea: <a href=""http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.levitated.net&#x2F;bones&#x2F;walkingFaces&#x2F;index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.levitated.net&#x2F;bones&#x2F;walkingFaces&#x2F;index.html</a>",story,https://crapple.mobi/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We operate mostly in the word game vertical with a few exceptions. Users find us mostly through organic search and we monetize through display ads.<p>We serve more than 20M users and 200M page views monthly and generate a yearly revenue of ~$5M. We had several opportunities to sell the business but so far we are confident that we can grow the business beyond the current valuation.<p>Hence, we are looking to hire an experienced group of leaders who can execute the growth vision of the company together with us. Specifically we think that we need to hire a Product Owner (PM), a Tech Lead (CTO) and a Data Analyst (Data Lead) in the first batch that will make the three of us replaceable and can continue the expansion of the team.<p>We have a few talented people in our team already (developers, SEOs, COO) and a couple of incredible partnerships with third parties, but we are clearly in need of tech minded leaders who can tie everything together.<p>I have no experience with hiring at this calibre so my question is how to best approach this? Are there agencies who can help put together a team to help us run the company? Where and how do I find the right type of individuals who are up for the task?<p>We are willing to reinvest significantly in salaries and growth but I find that hiring requires a lot of time which I currently don&#x27;t have.
