I&#x27;m in my late 20s, so there is no space for making wrong calls.<p>Due to the proliferation of various educational institutions, both local and international, I&#x27;m looking for reliable methods to determine whether a particular one is &quot;legit.&quot; What does that mean? Well, I&#x27;m sure you know, but let&#x27;s make it clear: it should be reputable enough so that the degree holder is taken seriously among employers and isn&#x27;t ridiculed by colleagues.<p>We live in the &quot;diploma mills&quot; era where for-profit companies disguised as universities sell diplomas to naive students. The criteria to get one are often low or non-existent, as long as one pays the tuition fees.<p>Where I&#x27;m at, the situation with public universities is slightly better but far from confidence-inspiring. The forums I frequent are full of lost students falling off the uni&#x27;s assembly lines with neither knowledge nor real-world experience. Of course, there are some brilliant people, too, but they&#x27;re almost an exception to the rule.<p>TL;DR: how to pick a good school?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
