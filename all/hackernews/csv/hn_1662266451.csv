But from what my experience, written word one-on-one has many advantages. It is easy to look up what was said. Another difference is that written word is persistent, meanwhile spoken usually isn&#x27;t. You could use some technology to transcribe it and store the text somewhere to get these advantages, but It is not very common (assuming it works flawlessly, text always does). It also has advantages of not having various time constrains. This mostly means eliminating the urgency of having to answer immediately (which you still can) and therefore you can think about it more. Furthermore, it&#x27;s easier to receive these messages rather than having a talk, and therefore it&#x27;s easier to intertwine the downtime of not having a quick answer with another activity.
