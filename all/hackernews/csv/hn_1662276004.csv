Not that auditing firms have a great track record either.<p>I&#x27;m interested in privacy, and basic ideas of cryptography, trying to build a different web, although I don&#x27;t think web3 represent my idea of a better internet.<p>The blockchain development environment is incredibly fragmented, moving at an extremely fast pace. There are so many competing chains, all doing things differently, with their own languages, protocols, tokens...so on.
