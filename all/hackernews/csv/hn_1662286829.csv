Submitting an ID to LinkedIn is a no-go. I have been over the years already 3 times in this situation.<p>Last time it happened when I logged in through the LinkedIn app on my phone, that I didn&#x27;t have a VPN connection running, and I guess the sudden geographical jump of my IP triggered LinkedIn.<p>I can&#x27;t keep going on like this, to discover with each new profile that I make once every 2-3 years another bit of info that may trigger LinkedIn (I have read up on various triggers, and they keep shifting). Is there a comprehensive list of what I have to do to avoid this fate the next time?<p>I would also be happy to pay for LinkedIn to avoid getting restricted, but again I don&#x27;t feel comfortable using my personal credit card, because I don&#x27;t want to give LinkedIn any other data point than a frugal version of my CV.
I&#x27;m wondering whether perhaps my name already is permanently &quot;tainted&quot; so that it will automatically get restricted due to my past attempts.<p>Do you use an agency to manage your LinkedIn profile? I&#x27;d be willing to spent a reasonable one-off amount for someone to let me know precisely what I have to do to avoid.<p>Are there specialists out there that can manage a privacy-aware LinkedIn profiles?<p>It MUST somehow be possible to balance the need for a reasonable level of privacy with the need of having a LinkedIn account that is robust under using VPNs etc. and that I just use to received some recruiter mail every once in a while (no crazy attempts to hoard connections etc.).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
