32715624,Ask HN: IPv4 mass scans – do many Cloudflare customers pay pointlessly?,2022-09-04T17:45:56Z,unknownaccount,1,false,false,3,"[32715813,32715668]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"A few months ago I discovered a service called CrimeFlare, which is a security research tool that is used to uncover the &quot;real&quot; IP address of services hidden behind CloudFlare&#x27;s CDN. The tool works by performing mass IP scans on IPv4 range. As many of us techies are probably aware, there is only a limited number of IPv4 IPs in the world. A number small enough such that specialized software is capable of connecting to every IPv4 address in the world in a matter of hours(on a sufficiently powerful network). There are companies who&#x27;s entire business model is based on performing mass internet scans, and scan multiple times per day - it is nothing unusual.<p>This has the unintended consequence of inadvertently revealing the &quot;real&quot; IP of websites attempting to mask their IP behind CloudFlare. This is how the &quot;CrimeFlare&quot; service works under the hood. In order to prevent this, website operators are supposed to configure their server&#x27;s backends such that they only respond to CloudFlare&#x27;s IPs. This works of course, however, I suspect that many of their customers are not aware of how CrimeFlare&#x2F;mass IP scans work and fail to configure their servers correctly. Meaning, a large number of CloudFlare&#x27;s customers pay for a service which can easily be defeated. Only CloudFlare customers which are tech savvy enough to understand how to configure their servers to only respond to CloudFlare IP&#x27;s would be able to stop this.<p>CLoudFlare supposedly has 4.1 million customers. I suspect that the number of CloudFlare customer&#x27;s who&#x27;s backend servers are vulnerable(misconfigured to reply to non-CloudFlare IPs - and thus discoverable by CrimeFlare et al.) may be in the hundreds of thousands to millions. Meaning, hundreds of thousands of people could be paying for an easily defeated anti-DDOS measure. It feels wrong that CloudFlare is possibly making tens of millions of dollars off of vulnerable customers who they fail to notify that their sites are vulnerable. I don&#x27;t believe enough is being done by CloudFlare to warn their customers about the danger of mass-IP scans possibly unmasking their services.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
