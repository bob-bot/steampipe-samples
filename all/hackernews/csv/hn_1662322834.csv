It is substantially more even though we do the same work. Though I&#x27;ve known about this policy, getting to know the numbers is extremely jarring. It&#x27;s causing a lot of resentment and detachment to work from my side.<p>I&#x27;ve raised this issue with my manager and they&#x27;ve told me that I can transfer if i want those pay scales but that&#x27;s not a possibility for me. If the company is willing to pay me that amount in a different location, why can&#x27;t it pay me the same here?<p>The reasons they&#x27;ve given me are weak and I want to debunk them.<p>1) cost of living - a lot of my colleagues are in locations where they can buy independent houses which are cheaper than an appartment in the city I live. Real estate in my country runs on black money, and I&#x27;ll probably never be able to own a house. Some of the EU countries provide free health care and education, I&#x27;m just a major health issue away from poverty. Most of them come from nuclear family cultures, where as I take care of my retired parents and younger siblings, and if i get married that&#x27;s a whole new family.<p>2) talent - if they are more talented than me then why am I in a more senior role than them. And my talent won&#x27;t change if I change location so why should my salary<p>3) something about not trapping in a high salary job - I dont even know what to say about this. I would love to be in that trap instead of the one I&#x27;m in right now where I&#x27;m being forced to migrate, where I would loose my family, friends and all the support structures I&#x27;ve built around me, to receive the same benefits as my peers.<p>This seems senseless to me.

It feels like a poverty tax and I&#x27;ve never felt more like a cog in a machine.<p>What do others think about this and how do you deal with this?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
