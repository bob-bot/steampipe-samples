I am an engineer&#x2F;part-time photographer that works a lot with photo&#x2F;video editing, and at the same time, have a couple of active Mobile Apps as side projects going on. My previous Mac from 2015 is showing sings of slow death and I wanted to jump onto Apple Silicon.<p>Wanted to see if 16GB is enough for me or would it be better to get a 32GB RAM instead. My idea is to keep it for at least 3-4 years from now. My use case is: Photoshop, some photo editing, video processing, and then, Mobile game development (Android mainly), maybe some work with Docker (running 5-6 containers simultaneously) while having other tools like Android Studio, Zoom, Brave and Edge Browsers with 20 tabs each, etc. open<p>Thanks a lot for the help!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The even easier way is to just use an existing player like video js. But I want to start off by building my own solution.<p>I have the basic player working (still some race conditions to be resolved), so now I am starting to look at tracking viewing behavior. I need to know things like timestamp till which a viewer has watched the video, at what timestamps they paused&#x2F;played&#x2F;forwarded it, when they wanted to seek to an earlier time and rewatch a part of it, etc. etc.<p>Say I start a timer when the viewer presses play. Then for each (milli)second I can check the timestamp of the video - this will let me track if some parts of the video were replayed or fast forwarded. Whenever the viewer presses play&#x2F;pause&#x2F;forward, I record the event.  I send this info to the server every 1 or 2 or 5 seconds and do the analytics.<p>Since I haven&#x27;t done this sort of thing before, I would love to have some inputs on if this ^ is the right approach.<p>Does it make sense to treat this data as a timeseries data? If not (even if it is), what else is a good way to organize this data?<p>I assume something like Cassandra (which I haven&#x27;t used much) is much better suited for this than Postgres (which I am comfortable with).
