I have a math background and I do lots of programming - Matlab, R, Python, even some web apps in R&#x2F;Shiny and hosting my own, very basic static site - but it&#x27;s nothing like modern web development as far as I can tell (the crux is usually the math&#x2F;stats modelling and data handling). It&#x27;s just dizzying trying to get on top of how many web dev tools&#x2F;frameworks&#x2F;languages there are and how fast everything seems to be changing.<p>Been lurking here and reading up for a while, I just wanted to ask for some tips before I start. I feel like I have a decent grasp of the programming basics (data structures, OOP,...) and Linux CL, and I have an idea for a simple (Sudoku) app that I&#x27;d like to build. My idea was to look for tutorials and try to build that app using eg Next.js&#x2F;React, Tailwind and TypeScript (hoping that those are among the most recent and will be state of the art at least for a while), and then try to host it using something like Heroku or Netlify. I found [0] quite inspiring and plan to use the stack as a bit of a reference. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need a backend yet, but later I might like to add some functional language (eg Erlang or Clojure) to my stack because I like the paradigm intellectually, if that makes any sense (over something like Go or just using Python which I already know). I know how to write SQL queries (and also data modelling&#x2F;normalization), I don&#x27;t fully understand what difference eg Postgres vs SQLite would make once I need a DB (other than that the latter is easier but has a hard limit, apparently). Any thoughts on that plan, tips&#x2F;suggestions&#x2F;things that I&#x27;m missing?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32376154",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
