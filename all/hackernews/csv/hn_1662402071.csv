The Echo, Siri, etc. just work most of the time, but Google is frequently way off the mark, requiring us to interrupt the device&#x27;s incorrect response and restate commands with exaggerated enunciation.<p>Do others have similar experiences?

Basically, every user is an invite of another user and those invites accrue over time making it very difficult to build up a malicious presence while simultaneously making it very easy to prune entire branches of users and content. Right now, users have to wait a week before inviting another user and they can only store a maximum of 10 invites at any time. For the next 2 days, I&#x27;m opening up registration so Hackernews users can test it out if anyone wants to. It&#x27;s very much in a beta stage so data will likely be wiped before an official release. Go Crazy<p>Clades started as a pandemic project that sat on the backburner for a long time before I realized that there may interest for it and I started polishing it up. The idea behind it is to foster the growth of small, niche communities either centered around where you live or things you&#x27;re interested in. The goal is not to become the next big platform but rather to provide a quiet place where a community doesn&#x27;t have to worry about brigading, drive by vandalism, or the ever present bot menace. Clades is designed to not store sensitive information like emails and tries to have a minimal data footprint while still supporting passwordless logins...if the database were compromised, no personal information could be retrieved besides usernames.<p>I&#x27;m just a single hobby dev with a full time non-software job and I haven&#x27;t really launched anything successfully yet so this is all new to me.
