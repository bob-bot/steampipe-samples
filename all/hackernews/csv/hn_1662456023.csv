32734445,Ask HN: Is it pointless to report hosting Abuse?,2022-09-06T08:29:14Z,skilled,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey everyone,<p>I was recently targeted by a spam campaign for one of my projects, and all of the IP addresses were pointing back to being hosted by OVH.<p>After parsing my logs, I put together all the information and sent through the OVH&#x27;s Abuse form.<p>To my surprise, I received the following email back:<p>---<p>&quot;It&#x27;s important to note that most of our services are rented &quot;unmanaged&quot; to our customers. This means that we only have physical access to the server and cannot access its content (no root, administrator, or user access). We are technically unable to modify or delete content, or making an abusive behavior stop by intervening directly on the server, as it is not managed by us.<p>We will however transmit the technical information of your report to the customer managing the infrastructure concerned, and we will follow this ticket to its resolution.&quot;<p>---<p>So why this is surprising is that first, they can&#x27;t actually &quot;check&quot; the server because it is &quot;unmanaged&quot;. And second, they will pass the information I sent them to the owner of the machines that have been spamming me.<p>Uhm.... what? That is quite literally like shooting myself in the foot. In other words, OVH is passing on the information that I am being targeted by this person&#x27;s machine. If I am the direct target, this is like poking a bear and asking it not to harm you.<p>Sadly, I never got any follow-up emails from OVH about this even though they state that they will &quot;follow to its resolution&quot;.<p>But, at the same time, if I parse my logs for things like bots scanning for .env files - there are thousands of machines that actively do this, and 99% of them have been reported by hundreds of others on sites like AbuseIPDB, etc.<p>And yet none of these hosting companies do anything?<p>So, my question is, unless you have the means to hire a lawyer or have a registered business entity - is it pretty much pointless to report spammers unless you want to anger them some more and get caught up in an even bigger mess?<p>Any thoughts on this? Any articles you recommend or maybe you have experiences to share?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
