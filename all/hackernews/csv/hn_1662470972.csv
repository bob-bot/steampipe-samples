32736817,Launch HN: FlyCode (YC S22) – Let product teams edit web apps without coding,2022-09-06T13:28:53Z,JakeVacovec,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN community, we are Jake, Tzachi and Etai, co-founders of FlyCode (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flycode.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flycode.com&#x2F;</a>). FlyCode makes it easy for product, UX, and marketing teams to edit web apps without coding, so they don’t have to wait on (or consume) developer time, and can iterate, test, and release faster. See a quick example here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jDL5oa2nEHo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jDL5oa2nEHo</a><p>Non-technical teams frequently need to edit the copy (text), images, and links that appear in a web app. How to manage these has long been a pain on software projects. You can keep them separate from the code, in some form that non-programmers can edit, but this adds a lot of complexity and is usually brittle, as it can bypass the regular development workflows (as CI, staging envs &amp; deploy previews). It’s simpler to keep them in the code—but then only programmers can easily edit them. Everyone else has to wait to get their changes in, plus the devs have to do a lot of edits that aren’t their main work. This slows projects down and is expensive. It also means that product&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;UX teams can’t do things that require rapid iteration, such as sophisticated forms of A&#x2F;B or usability testing. This limits their work and ultimately is bad for both quality and revenue.<p>There have been many approaches to solving this dilemma, including custom built admin tools that are limited in functionality and require maintenance, offloading to CMS that require heavy integration, are normally used for simple static apps, and bind your stack to their SDKs. Or wasting a developer’s time to do it for you…<p>We took a new approach by automatically analyzing a codebase’s structure, similar to a compiler. This allows us to automatically populate our platform in which product&#x2F;UX&#x2F;marketing teams can easily use to edit their text and images. We programmatically turn those edits into code changes. Our GitHub bot then takes these code changes and creates a pull request just like a developer would—but without the latency (and boredom!). Developers retain codebase ownership, while non-developers become individual contributors to the dev process, just like the others.<p>We use well-established practices for parsing and editing source code (like <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;jscodeshift"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;jscodeshift</a>), covering most of the major technologies used for building web apps (React, Angular, Vue, and Ruby on Rails included).<p>Once our software has parsed your codebase, it generates an editing portal for your app that teams can easily use to find, manage, and edit product copy, images, and links, and then auto-generate PRs. You can edit product copy regardless of whether it is in resource files or hardcoded (fun fact: some of the largest and fastest-growing tech companies have most of their strings hardcoded!), and you can replace and upload new images and icons to your product.<p>The integration with GitHub (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flycode.com&#x2F;developers"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flycode.com&#x2F;developers</a>)  took us a long time to get right. There’s not a lot of documentation around integrating GitHub to platforms, and things like connecting an org or connection requests turned out to be non-trivial. We&#x27;re particularly proud of the result because unlike with other tools, you don’t have to do any significant integration work.<p>Our GitHub app finds texts and images in the source code and sends them to our platform (you have full control of what and where we scan). Once a user requests a change it updates the texts and the images in the codebase and creates a pull request.<p>We did a Show HN earlier this year: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31166924"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31166924</a>, which helped us get some serious leads, which was awesome. Since then we’ve moved out of beta, added new content types (images), launched a new UI and visual editor (EAP), and automated the onboarding of new repos.<p>We have a handful of companies paying for this and spent the last year focusing on making it extremely simple to use. It only takes 3 minutes to connect our GitHub app and configure the system for your team to start editing. It doesn’t require any changes to your code, or any special maintenance. You can get started here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.flycode.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.flycode.com</a><p>We are hoping to use this launch to get some more feedback from you all! We are far from our vision to be a platform for everything front-end but are working hard every day to improve the user experience and feature requests from our early collaborators (editing links, themes, variables, JSON configuration, defining in-code A&#x2F;B tests, etc.).<p>We&#x27;re really happy to show this to you all and thank you for reading about it. For those that sign up, time yourself to check that our “3-minute connect + config” claim isn&#x27;t just a sales tactic! We look forward to further conversation in the comments.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It is the only way could think to succinctly describe what I need; and I suspect could be useful for other multi-disciplinary, generalist hackers that can turn their hand to any language or project and generate a lot of miscellaneous documenation, code, patches, and shell scripts.<p>Summary: Wanting a static site generator that (possibly via plug-ins) understands (or can be made to understand) Apache httpd mod-include conditional server-side-include (SSI) directives as an integral part of page content generation.<p>Over 20+ years I&#x27;ve generated thousands of hacking-focused small (and large) documentation of bug hunts, notes, transcripts, exposés, instructions, shell scripts and more. Most is either in Markdown, hand-edited HTML, or currently on-someone-elses-computer in the form of posts and comments across many sites (including HN) and I intend extracting those to Markdown locally to ensure I have a single source for everything and it cannot go AWOL.<p>I&#x27;m aiming to integrate them into a single static web site hosted by Apache httpd utilising mod-include[0] to do some clever server-side include abstract inclusion in index pages without any text duplication across multiple index pages, and with no use of dynamic server-side or client-side languages (so no PHP or Javascript).<p>The end result I want is each &#x27;issue&#x27; in a single well-formed HTML5 page with semantic elements, embedded meta tags for classifying into one or more categories to enable generation of indexes, overview lists, tag clouds, or whatever.<p>The aim is to have abstracts (summaries) of issue pages included in the index&#x2F;overview&#x2F;category&#x2F;tag-cloud pages via mod-include by only taking the title and first paragraph. In an index page e.g:<p><pre><code>  &lt;body class=&quot;index&quot;&gt;
  ...
  &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;issue-0001.html&quot; --&gt;
  ...
  &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;issue-0002.html&quot; --&gt;
  ...
  &lt;!--#include virtual=&quot;issue-0003.html&quot; --&gt;
  ...
</code></pre>
and in the issue pages simply have some conditional server-side include code that determines if the page is being included in another - and if so only include the title and abstract text and not the entire HTML document.<p>The bonus for the index pages here is to use HTML5 semantic element &quot;&lt;details&gt;&quot; in order to have the browser automatically collapse the details text and show a &#x27;reveal&#x27; icon next to it:<p><pre><code>  &lt;!--#if expr=&#x27;v(&quot;SSL_LEVEL&quot;) -eq 0&#x27; --&gt;
  &lt;DOCTYPE html&gt;
  ...
    &lt;style&gt;
     details:
    &lt;&#x2F;style&gt;
    &lt;&#x2F;head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;!--#endif --&gt;
     &lt;details &lt;!--#if expr=&#x27;v(SSL_LEVEL&quot;) -eq 0&#x27; --&gt;open&lt;!--#endif --&gt; &gt;
      &lt;summary&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Issue title&lt;h1&gt;&lt;&#x2F;summary&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;First paragraph of article containing the summary&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
     &lt;&#x2F;details&gt;
  &lt;!--#if expr=&#x27;v(&quot;SSL_LEVEL&quot;) -eq 0&#x27; --&gt;
   ...

  &lt;&#x2F;html&gt;
  &lt;!--#endif --&gt;
</code></pre>
This fragment adds the &quot;open&quot; attribute to &quot;&lt;details&gt;&quot; when the entire page is requested so the title and first para are shown by default. The index page has CSS to reduce the impact of the &quot;&lt;h1&gt;&quot; in the &quot;&lt;summary&gt;&quot;; e.g:<p><pre><code>  .index details summary h1 {font-size: 14pt; font-weight: normal;}
</code></pre>
