As in, take the value prop underlying gold, and push it to its logical conclusion:<p>- Value is fundamentally a coordination game, and gold is valuable because it&#x27;s a natural coordination point, owing to: [1] limited supply growth (i.e. scarce) [2] persistent (i.e. doesn&#x27;t decay much), and [3] compellingly due to... being shiny.<p>- Similarly, SoV0 aims to be an even more natural coordination point by satisfying all of these properties to the maximum extent possible:  
[1] fixed supply [2] zero fees (basically fees = decay), and [3] compelling elegance of being the simplest possible thing that can satisfy fixed supply &amp; zero fees.<p>In terms of design, SoV0 is about as basic as a blockchain can be: just a text document detailing who owns how much of the asset, plus some basic support for sending &amp; receiving assets.  The main challenge here (and SoV0&#x27;s core novelty) is how to enforce proper operation of such a system without monetary incentives.  This requires that SoV0 be intentionally limited in functionality (e.g. slow, no smart contract support, too coarse to be a currency).  As a result, there&#x27;s no need for fees to regulate the system, and consensus can be directly maintained by users rather than explicitly paid for (as in rewards in proof of work &#x2F; stake).  More details in the whitepaper: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sov0&#x2F;sov0"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sov0&#x2F;sov0</a>.<p>More broadly: Our interest in the blockchain space is strongly motivated by an aesthetic preference for building &#x27;ideal&#x27; institutions that can eventually exist in a fixed form forever, and thus feel more like fundamental aspects of the world than typical human constructs (so, more like Bitcoin, less like the Ethereum or other modern general-purpose L1 blockchains).  SoV0 is our first attempt at applying this approach to the simplest possible case: a pure store coordinated value store.<p>I&#x27;ll do my best to answer any questions here.
