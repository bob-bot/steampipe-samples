32743329,"Ask HN: I am tired of being a manager, how to escape this trap?",2022-09-06T21:19:12Z,danrocks,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I currently work as an M2 (L7) software development manager at a FAANG company. I lead multiple teams (~35 people total) building critical software for the company&#x27;s infrastructure. Systems that hit millions of transactions per second and have tangible impact in the user experience of millions of customers.<p>I hate every minute of it.<p>The long, grueling days sitting in meetings, some of them relevant, but many with just very senior people blabbering and requesting more data and more discussions and more meetings. The inability to do anything technical, being very passionate about system design and coding. The constant complains from my engineers about topics I have no jurisdiction over (TC). I am so tired of it.<p>I was pushed to management due to being right a few more times than wrong, having good communication skills, and being a kind leader. It&#x27;s a trap I want to get out of, but I can&#x27;t figure out how. Fortunately I was still writing code about 3 months ago (different company) so I am still fluent and my skills haven&#x27;t atrophied. But for 20 years of experience I have, 10+ years in management certainly mean I am not necessarily a &quot;guru&quot; I should be at my age (43). This may signal trouble in the marketplace if I try to find an SDE job.<p>Another problem is that, with my experience, I may be able only to find a job as an engineer in enterprise software, where engineers don&#x27;t code. Another trap, judging from how unhappy my engineers are at having to spend their days writing documents for similar meetings to the ones I described above.<p>I make very high TC (mid-high six figures) but I am willing to give that up for a job where I can just design and write software. I am also ok going down a level or two. I am hell bent on doing it, just need a few ideas of what the next steps could be, anecdotes from people who took the plunge, success&#x2F;failure stories, all of it. Just shoot it.<p>I also fully understand that this may be the &quot;grass is greener&quot; effect taking hold, but even if going back to IC is not all that I think it&#x27;s cut out to be, it will be an improvement to my current professional mental state.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
