32744770,Ask HN: Should I pivot away from writing software?,2022-09-07T00:08:24Z,throwaway0x1337,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve been writing code for longer than I&#x27;d like to admit, but never professionally - if we exclude a couple of miserably paid gigs on freelancing websites. Frankly, I had to choose a career back then. Since I heard programming was lucrative and a golden ticket to living abroad, it looked like a no-brainer. I spent years working on my projects, reading technical books, and doing mathematics. However, I don&#x27;t think I ever truly fell in love with all that. I mean, it&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;ve done more amusing things (which I shouldn&#x27;t have) that now cloud my reasoning. Anyway, I&#x27;ve given it a shot.<p>I think I like other things better, like law or languages. For example, I enjoy listening to someone speak, e.g. Greek or Spanish. Unlike programming, I know I&#x27;d be good at this. I know I wouldn&#x27;t make the same mistakes I made when studying software engineering and computer science. But, there are very few options for a language person - you can be a translator&#x2F;interpreter, a writer, or a teacher - none of which fit my description of a good job. The other issue is that I&#x27;m knees deep in software engineering, and there is a &quot;sunk cost fallacy&quot; moment. I don&#x27;t know; maybe things would change for the better if I had a real job that pays real money. I keep hearing that you need to love what you do professionally; otherwise, you will have a bad time doing it. This isn&#x27;t very encouraging because, after numerous thorough self-investigations, I can say that programming barely qualifies as an &quot;ok&quot; thing to do.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
