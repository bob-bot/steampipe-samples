32745917,Ask HN: Does your Safari also get this annoying bug?,2022-09-07T03:06:10Z,trevcanhuman,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Does iOS Safari also crash on your iPhone ?<p>About a month ago I got this weird crash on safari. Everything was working fine.
I was just searching on duckduckgo and all of a sudden I get this [0], [1].
&quot;A problem repeatedly ocurred on $URL&quot;
Now all my safari tabs crashed. I hit refresh, I change the url. I go to any other website and it still shows the error.<p>Killing the app does not work. Maybe something to do with webkit ? 
The only thing that worked the first time was installing the latest iOS update (15.6), I had 14.x.something before.<p>Search engine: duckduckgo<p>But the problem is that this issue is very weird. Some apple forums said that disabling javascript would restore Safari. It kinda did.<p>The first time this happened, it did not work and as mentioned before, o ly a full software update worked.<p>But guess what ? This bug happened to me today. Which means it has nothing to do with the new ios 15 update. This means it is weirdly reproducible. I don&#x27;t know what I did or how it happened but it happened again.
And for some reason, now disabling javascript worked like a charm and them re-enabling it un-killed the bug. Why ? I don&#x27;t know.<p>Also, does anyone know about how to go report this bug to Apple ?<p>Thanks<p>references<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;files.thetrevor.tech&#x2F;IMG_0857.PNG<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;files.thetrevor.tech&#x2F;IMG_0858.PNG",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
