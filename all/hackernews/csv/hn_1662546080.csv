As in many other countries, the tech industry here is characterized by very unequal gender representation, and we see the junior high programs as an opportunity to help bridge the gap. The difference is already apparent at the junior high stage - both the participation rates and retention rates are much lower for girls, and that&#x27;s something we&#x27;re trying to tackle. However there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much knowledge on how to actually do this, and I haven&#x27;t found relevant resources. Things I personally try to pay attention to when constructing the lessons &#x2F; projects are choosing examples from diverse domains (e.g. not just focusing on computer games - giving examples from science, art, engineering etc.), and providing female role models in stories (e.g. not portraying hackers &#x2F; computer scientists as male-only). However I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s enough. On the other hand, I don&#x27;t want to try too hard and achieve the opposite effect (patronizing etc.)<p>Any advice?<p>In case it&#x27;s relevant, the organization developing the programs is non-profit, and the programs are partially &#x2F; fully subsidized by the government for disadvantaged communities.<p>Thanks!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
