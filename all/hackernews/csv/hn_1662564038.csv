We help DevOps teams from high growth startups (EBANX, Dock) and public companies (Enjoei, RD Station) controlling prod and PII (sensitive data) access.

    It seems like you have these challenges, and I was hoping you’d be able to help us out by sharing your personal feedback and insights on security for k8s, aws, and other cloud tools. Even a quick 10-minute phone conversation while you’re on-the-go (walking your dog, or getting your morning coffee, whichever is easiest for you..), would be much appreciated. Please let me know if possible to arrange, I’ll adjust according to your availability.
