I feel like typically the next step is moving up to Tech Lead or Management and I don&#x27;t think it sounds fun to manage a team of engineers as far as career growth etc. I do enjoy designing processes on how we hire people, writing code tests, and interviewing. I also think I have a good eye on the product, what we should do next etc. I&#x27;ve also been told that if I wasn&#x27;t in tech I would be great at sales FWIW.<p>Writing code started as a hobby for me that I turned into a career. I&#x27;ve been pondering the idea of where my career could go if I wanted to be more out of the code from 9-5. I would then turn coding back into a hobby that I do just for me and work on only things I find interesting. If I had to choose between Tech Lead and becoming a Manager I&#x27;d be more interested in Tech Lead. Although I think I want to be less technical&#x2F;in the code and more operational.<p>Currently work at a small startup that is on the verge of landing the funding for a Series A round so as far as roles, the sky is the limit as I&#x27;m in on the ground floor. We already pretty much have a shoo-in for the head of engineering(only have 1 staff engineer atm) so that&#x27;s probably out of the question.<p>Looking for suggestions on where I could go career-wise, all insight would be helpful thanks!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
