Our tool will two-way sync Slack &amp; Linear data:<p>1. New messages in the Slack channels you wish to sync will automatically create new issues in Linear.<p>2: Threaded replies in Slack reply will become a comment on the Linear ticket.<p>3: Adding a comment in Linear will automatically send a message to the original Slack thread.<p>Teams with lots of Slack messages internally and externally should find this tool useful. Eng teams can use Linear to track on-call request and manage issue status and prioritization in Linear. Product communities can use Linear as an internal ticketing platform to ensure that all customer questions receive replies.<p>We would love to hear any feedback or what other tools you would like to sync together. Cheers!",story,https://pragmatic-star-359521.uw.r.appspot.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
