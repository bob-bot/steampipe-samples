Likewise, you can submit feedback once you created an account and navigate to the settings screen by clicking on the settings bottom tab icon where you’ll see a button to submit feedback.<p>In addition, the app is available for download. Please keep in mind the app is open for testing to the public and I expect bugs lol. Once again, I would appreciate feedback :).<p>Remember, KEEP MOVING FORWARD, NEVER give up, and stay on your purpose and achieve your dreams and goals. YOU got this, keep the faith, and KEEP WORKING AND BELIEVING - dream, work, build, and create.<p>Peace and much love family!",story,https://tech-noise-io.vercel.app/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

That team handles things like staging environments, CI&#x2F;CD pipelines, and general tooling that enables developers at our company to be productive.<p>I&#x27;m inclined to say yes because I feel this will be a good opportunity for growth for me as a manger, especially given that the work is in parts of our tech stack that I&#x27;m less familiar with.<p>However, I was wondering if anyone has any advice or wisdom to consider when making this choice. If you happen to manage a team like this, what has your experience been like?  Do you know of any articles or blog posts that can shed some insight as to what it is like?<p>Thanks!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
