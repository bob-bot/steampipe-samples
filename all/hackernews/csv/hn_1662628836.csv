I am more interested in niche topics like optimization, simulations, numerical mathematics, but also more general ones like machine learning. Unfortunately I am having to cross most otherwise exciting potential companies out because the location just sucks.<p>Remote: First of all, remote is now trendy so to get it out of the way. I just hate communicating remotely. If something cannot be conveyed through email, then I need to meet in person. Video chat somehow does not work. Plus I need the office environment for networking reasons.<p>Small cities: Here is my problem with small cities. I do not want to move to your small city just for your company. What do I do in three years when I want to advance? Uproot my life again and move to another city? No thanks. Also social, networking, career and even hobby opportunities are limited. Unfortunately lots of companies in the niches I prefer are founded by middle aged men, who prefer living in small cities. I would also prefer that if I was a settled middle aged man, but I&#x27;m not.<p>University cities: University cities can be either great or terrible, depending on what kind of people the university attracts. Unfortunately, when a university city becomes known as a tech hub, it ruins the local culture. I do not want to feel like I am surrounded by tech coworkers everywhere I go.<p>Very big cities: Is what I prefer. However it is a compromise. They come with their own challenges. High cost of living. Lots of foreigners, make the local culture and in particular personal relationships transient. However at least, one can reasonably expect to be able to find new career opportunities within the same city. Social and networking opportunities are also highest in these locations.<p>Finally salary: Employers in less popular areas pay less, because of the lack of other opportunities in the region. Hello? What? I am already taking a penalty to move to your desolate region. Now you pay me less on top of that? Rubbing salt in the wound.<p>There is no point to this post. It is just a rant. If you are an employer you might understand why you&#x27;re finding a hard time attracting talent.<p>I guess if you want a take away: salaries only consider cost of living, but should also consider social and future career opportunities in the equation. Yes I can rent for much lower, but I will also find it hard to advance in my career and living in this location is just less rewarding.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
