We want to help make Open Source more sustainable and believe that we can be a part of making that happen.<p>We&#x27;re approaching this from the perspective of the individual developer - if you contribute to OSS then you can register instantly with your GitHub account and list yourself to provide paid support, knowledge and help for the repositories that you contribute to. We only allow those who we can prove contribute to repositories to list themselves as experts, and show details of contribution history for the experts in the system so that customers can see exactly how the experts can help.<p>We process payments to over 100 different countries via Stripe, and handle all of the paperwork to make the process as frictionless as possible, including 1099s for US based experts.<p>We&#x27;re building out tools to improve the developer experience at the moment, and have started to work with customers to design a process that allows them to access expertise quickly whilst working within the constraints of an enterprise environment.<p>For the past 3 or so weeks we have been in an Alpha stage, so this is our Beta launch - we are really open to fresh ideas and opinions. From day 1 I have said to every developer that I have spoken to that whether you love the idea or hate it, all I want to know is why and what we can do better - so HN, please tell me what you think and want it to be!",story,https://www.ringerhq.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Wall Street has a large informational edge.<p>2. Wrongdoing towards individual investors goes unpunished by the government and regulators, with a revolving door between these two and Wall Street.<p>3. Short-term frictional costs eat into a short-term trading style.<p>4. Brokerages now have a business model of selling customer trades to financial institutions. This is rife with conflicts of interest and abuse, with limited transparency.<p>5. Brokerages are incentivized to push a bad trading style on their clients and do so, in order to maximize their own revenue.<p>Phoenix seeks to provide better financial outcomes for individuals actively trading markets, with no potential for trading losses for any participants, but a real chance for big gains.<p>We aim to reduce the $1trn loss of active individual investors by 98% (we plan to take the last 2% as our revenue), and to build a new community and product for them that has the core focus of improving investor outcomes. Every other individual investor brokerage product we’ve reviewed ultimately has the goal of exploiting them more, or in a new way. We’re taking a radically different approach.<p>How does this work?<p>Our core product doesn’t involve any interaction with real financial markets or institutions. Instead, we simply ingest market data into our app, and all customer trades are virtual based on these real prices. This means that investors trade in exactly the same way as they would in a real brokerage, just with simpler liquidity, algorithmic derivative pricing, and no real consequences if things go wrong (like margin calls, taxes on unrealized gains, or debt from losses on margin). This also means there are no deposits or fees required to participate in Phoenix. Investors who do well don’t make trading profit, but instead earn rewards based on their ranking on our leaderboard in each day or week.<p>We generate the money for these rewards by taking subscription revenue in exchange for a variety of premium features that we offer associated with our ecosystem. This revenue feeds the value of a crypto token, which then automatically distributes rewards based on the ranking charts.<p>Want more information?<p>Visit phoenix-trade.io&#x2F;docs for more info<p>We don’t offer an account-less demo as most of our features depend on referencing a specific user.
