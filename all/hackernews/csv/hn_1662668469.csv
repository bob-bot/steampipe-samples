Apparently that&#x27;s not the case for all configurations, but the bug has been encountered on Windows 8, 10 and 11.<p>We are a small startup with ~20 windows laptops, with recent hardware and legit licences. And since a few days it&#x27;s chaos because everyone is having the bitlocker message and is not always able to find its recovery key (without the key you lose all your data). Because finding the key requires you to remember which email address you used to create your Microsoft account, and because for some reasons sometimes the key doesn&#x27;t even show up on the account.<p>I&#x27;m the CTO in charge and I&#x27;m doing all the sys admin stuff myself, which is probably not a good idea as it appears now.
Up to now I had never heard about bitlocker (I don&#x27;t use windows myself). I guess that&#x27;s the case for many small organizations or individuals. This bug is a ticking time bomb for all of them. I&#x27;m baffled to say the least, that such a scenario can even occur. It has caused more damage to us than any ransomware attacks.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to hear if some you have experienced this situation and how you dealt with it.
Cheers",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
