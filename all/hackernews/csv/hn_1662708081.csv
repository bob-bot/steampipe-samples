It was rather shocking to learn that the presence of combining characters makes most &quot;reverse a string&quot; programming solutions incorrect, and that strings need to be normalized to compare them. The whole thing seems so much more complicated than it should be, but perhaps that&#x27;s just the nature of the problem?<p>Was Unicode designed well? If it were designed from scratch today, with no legacy considerations, would the ideal design look like the current design? What would you change?<p>Being extremely ignorant of the problem space, the first thing I would consider for the chopping block would be combining characters. Just make every character a precomposed character (one code point), so there&#x27;s no need for normalization. I&#x27;m curious if such a scheme could fit every code point into 32 bits, though. Would this be feasible?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
