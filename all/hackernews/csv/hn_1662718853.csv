32777486,Need storage plan for web development student(upgrading not buying new laptop)?,2022-09-09T10:17:38Z,shivajikobardan,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"*How much storage will a web development(FULL STACK)  learner need?*<p>I&#x27;m planning to learn web development, make personal projects(I Don&#x27;t need to host them to public professionally, heroku will do the job. And backups of codes can be stored in github once the project is completed) so that I can apply for jobs.<p>I currently have a 1 TB hard drive. I still have 650-700 GB of space left on hard drive. I&#x27;ve used it for more than 10000 hrs and the disk health isn&#x27;t looking great either. Plus due to lots of tech problems while running things, I decided it&#x27;s time to use hybrid storage. And SSD was a must according to the internet. (100% disk usage used to happen frequently and whenever I posted issues in forums&#x2F;internet&#x2F;google, people would ask if I use SSD and if not, they&#x27;d conclude that every problems would get fixed by a SSD. They could not really troubleshoot the real cause and I don&#x27;t have any qualified manpower in my country.)<p>So, I&#x27;m switching to SSD.<p>Every penny counts because we don&#x27;t make that much income. Thus, we can&#x27;t be extravagant. While buying 1TB SSD would still be utilized in some way or other, but I need higher return of what I pay(ie utilize sufficiently for web development purposes) Companies give a new laptop if you start working in them (Not to interns). After getting a job, buying laptops won&#x27;t be that hard although a laptop that serves my purpose will cost 7 months of new dev&#x27;s salary here.<p>Here&#x27;s my software requirements. The storage are just my guesses, your insights would be valuable here.<p>1) Windows 10&#x2F;11. It&#x27;ll take maximum 64 GB.
2) Microsoft Office Professional containing word,doc, ppt, excel. 4 GB
3) Brave browser (Not considering downloads for browser. Downloads can go to hard disk)
4) Chrome browser 100 MB for install, ? for cache?...etc please tell
5) Firefox browser 100MB for install
6) images2pdf softwares At most 1GB size(estimate)
7) cold turkey type softwar&#x2F; org emacs (only one) At most 1GB size(estimate)
8) IDE(probably VScode or pycharm whatever supports web development and is easy to use for beginners)
9) Web development installations (for 1 stack like MERN, MEAN etc) Not sure about it
10) Viber&#x2F;Telegram Downloads (Can be removed regularly on unwanted basis) 2GB but most of it can always be deleted or transferred back to hard drive if they&#x27;re really important. Or at all install viber outside of SSD.
11) Save codes and notes on Joplin while learning. Notes will contain images+codes+text. Not sure about estimate? They can be printed after some time and delete from laptop.
12) Note taking app on Joplin<p>My files storage requirements (of current):<p>1) Important docs 34.7MB
2) Study materials that needs to be saved forever 41.5 GB ( I can instead just keep a name of the book and download it later as they&#x27;re all downloaded from online. Almost&#x2F;More than 85% storage can be freed up here)
3) Very important courses downloads 103.16 GB
4) Unimportant courses 206.1 GB (I downloaded them online, It&#x27;s very less likely that I&#x27;m going to use them. They&#x27;re not very important. But I could need them if a course is really good or if the topic is really tough and I need multiple insights)<p>In my region, If 1 TB hard drive costs x, then 128GB pen drive costs 0.307x and 256GB SSD 0.538x and 512GB SSD costs 1.153x. I&#x27;m not mentioning budget because I&#x27;m not buying from amazon or any USA places. Everything cost 2x here so not much point doing it.<p>Can you share your ideas about what should I do?<p>My view:
1) Get 128GB pen drive to store 103.16GB Very Important Courses
2) Buy 256GB SSD. 64GB for OS and 192GB for files.<p>Would this plan work? Is there better approach to this?Remind of the things that I&#x27;m letting go unnoticed at the momet as well.<p>While I&#x27;ve said this for web development, I really would love information about android&#x2F;IOS app development setup required (storage only).<p>I&#x27;ll ask about RAM later on.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
