32783562,Show HN: BaoRnD – Gitlab x LinkedIn for projects involving little or no code,2022-09-09T19:09:29Z,alegeaa,1,false,false,1,[32783614],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello everyone<p>I am Aliyu, and I am introducing baoRnD.<p>baoRnD is a repository + networking solution. Think of it as GitLab + LinkedIn but for projects involving little or no code.<p>Problem<p>As researchers, we have lived with frustrations when it comes to organizing project files, communicating with stakeholders, and&#x2F;or publicizing our work. As an example, sharing my work or updates involves sharing online documents&#x2F;folder, sending local files from my computer, or explaining verbally or over email. Communicating with stakeholders (e.g. my supervisors), is also a headache because each stakeholder uses different communication channels, all of which are not built for RnD usage.<p>PhDs and university graduates are often forced to work on projects they&#x27;re not interested in for lack of better options.<p>Research papers are tough to understand! I mean, how many of us have ever understood any research paper the first time we read it?<p>Traditional industries are underserved by the available technological tools. Having spoken with many people in these industries, the current options they have are cumbersome emails or lengthy phone calls.<p>Solution<p>baoRnD has been built to solve this pain-point. It largely started as a way for me to solve the issues I was facing in my RnD life. But people showed interest.<p>Basically, it allows you to have all project files&#x2F;information and to conduct all project processes on one platform. We allow our users to host and manage RnD (Research and Development) projects, update and communicate with stakeholders, publicize their work, get support, and perform computations; At the same time, the general public can follow projects. You also get a lot of support from both the baoRnD employees (currently I and my co-founder.  and the large community already using baoRnD.<p>The networking aspect makes it easy for project owners to publicize their work. Here at baoRnD, we believe Understanding the process and having clear documentation of that, rather than just the final result (communicated with a paper) is the better way to share new knowledge or innovative work. The public can easily follow your work if you make your project public. Many of our users have gained important insights from discussions they&#x27;ve had with their project followers after they pushed new updates.<p>PhDs who are tired of always getting the worse end of the stick can join baoRnD to get project sponsors, get funded, or find and work on projects that interest them.<p>Aside from hosting and managing communication for your projects, some of the support that can be gotten from banRnD currently include:<p>1. Find researchers to join your RnD project.<p>2. Find collaborators on projects.<p>3. Find sponsors for your project.<p>4. Find resources, such as equipment, lab space, etc. Our Resource Center has lots of them waiting for grabs.<p>5. Request help from baoRnD in-house staff (for premium accounts only).<p>For startups<p>You may be thinking, this is not for startups. Actually, startups and SMEs who can’t afford to set up dedicated RnD departments (cos of reasons like high cost) find it a better option to put their project on baoRnD to find researchers willing to take them up. This does not only help you to find smart people interested in your work but also to test their abilities on real innovative projects and garner more awareness for your project. Big companies use baoRnD for the same reasons.<p>Our Ask<p>We humbly seek your support by asking you to sign up today and try our product out. If you&#x27;re not able to signup, please join the waitlist.<p>We are onboarding people on our waitlist a lot quicker now.<p>If you would like immediate access, please find someone already registered and ask them to refer you.<p>Thank you.",story,https://www.baornd.com/landing,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
