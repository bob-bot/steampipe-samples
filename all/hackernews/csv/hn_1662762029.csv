32785067,Ask HN: Prepaid flip phone that works out of the box to send to relative in need,2022-09-09T21:21:07Z,hairofadog,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi, HN. I&#x27;m hoping you can help me out with a phone recommendation.<p>I&#x27;ve got an adult sibling that lives across the country from me. They have mental health problems, and (after failing at extended negotiations trying to move them closer to me) I sent them an iPhone last year so we could at least keep in touch.<p>Now they&#x27;ve lost the iPhone, and I need to send a cheap flip phone with prepaid minutes to communicate while I arrange a replacement iPhone. Ideally, it would work out of the box (meaning, no complex sim-card activation, no visiting a phone store to negotiate activation or plans).<p>Do any of you have recommendations for such a phone? The various options seem like they would be difficult to activate and&#x2F;or are prohibitively expensive. This thing only has to work for a month or so and then it can be discarded.<p>I&#x27;m looking at Tracfones, but they require sending three different pieces (phone, SIM card, minutes) and I&#x27;m worried about how difficult the activation process will be. On Amazon I see something called &#x27;Easyfone&#x27; that works with Mint Mobile, but the instructions say you should activate the sim on a feature-phone and then move the sim back into the Easyfone, and that also seems difficult.<p>The requirements:<p><pre><code>    - Super easy setup
    - Cheap (~ $50-$75)
    - Makes calls
    - Receives calls
    - Prepaid plan
    - Ships relatively quickly
</code></pre>
Possible? Thanks in advance!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
