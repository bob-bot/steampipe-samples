As an IC on average I tend to outperform many of my peers in delivering features, finding optimal solutions.<p>But. My mind is quite slow in the initial phase of analyzing the problem, collecting the requirements, figuring out the best solution, edge cases etc.<p>This feature failed few faang interviews for me already.<p>It looks impossible to me to deliver a quality (or even just working correctly) code for rather complex puzzle in 40 minutes.<p>Even if it’s the puzzle I’ve already solved on leetcode. I have hard time memorizing stuff, it’s much easier for me to rebuild solution from scratch, once I understand the core idea. But it takes time.<p>So how do I get to faang or other company with comparable benefits if they all seems to be heavily biased towards  quick, rather than deep thinkers?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
