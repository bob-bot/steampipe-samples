Would this be considered constitutional? I can understand issuing penalties or otherwise stepping in to regulate businesses, but considering Bitcoin is an open-source, community driven software project (and so are many other crypto projects), can the government enforce that the software has to be written a certain way? Would this be considered a violation of the First Amendment?<p>I am sure in this specific case many people may agree with the intentions or believe that this change is not a problem, but the precedent to me is pretty scary. Imagine if in the future, rich and powerful people can lobby the government to limit or crush any open-source software they want if they feel like it poses a threat to an existing company or industry.<p>Based on this article, it sounds like code <i>is</i> considered free speech: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;wgbh&#x2F;nova&#x2F;article&#x2F;is-code-free-speech&#x2F;",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
