We didn&#x27;t raise much. The investors saw the product, the deck, had a call with us, and that was pretty much it.<p>I&#x27;m now raising a seed round for a new company. A few investors have asked for access to the Data Room, which I haven&#x27;t set-up, one asked for an &quot;Investor Memorandum&quot;, and other such things.<p>In our previous company, we were only raising $350k, we now have a hardware company and are raising $2M.<p>Is it common to have a Data Room and other supporting documents when raising your first Safe Note? Is it a function of the amount we are currently raising? Or is it a sign of the types of investors we are speaking with?  I know one of them has not done very many investments, and is very quite green.<p>To be clear, most investors are not asking for a Data Room, it&#x27;s only a few, so I&#x27;m just trying to understand what is special about these investors?<p>Do I need to change my expectations, or watch out for something with the investor?<p>When did you set-up your first Data Room?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
