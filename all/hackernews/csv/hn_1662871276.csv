32796822,Show HN: Quake VR – Quake (1996) as a first-class PCVR experience,2022-09-11T04:27:11Z,SuperV1234,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello HN!<p>I am proud to show you Quake VR, a &quot;labor of love&quot; one-man project that I started back in 2020 with the goal of turning Quake -- the timeless classic from 1996 -- into a <i>first-class</i> PCVR experience.<p>---<p>&gt; What do you mean by &quot;first-class&quot;?<p>There are many mods out there that enable older games to be played in VR, however, not much thought is put into VR-unique mechanics or in making the experience feel seamless.<p>While I do enjoy reliving nostalgic classics in VR (and thank the modders for their efforts), it does feel weird having to use a keyboard+mouse setup for a VR game, or -- even with motion controls -- not being able to physically interact with the game&#x27;s world, or having a gun glued to one of my hands.<p>With Quake VR, I tried my best to make the game feel like an experienced designed from the ground up for VR. A video is worth a thousand words: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MBoI16z8Nxg"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MBoI16z8Nxg</a><p>---<p>As you can see from the video above, Quake VR provides a plethora of VR-specific features, including:<p>- Virtual in-game hands with finger tracking
- Dual-wield weapons or hold a weapon with two hands
- Physical melee combat, including throwing weapons and headbutts
- Weapon models with ironsights
- Collisions between the player&#x27;s hands and the environment
- Holster system with virtual torso<p>For a complete list of features, check out the README: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vittorioromeo&#x2F;quakevr#main-features"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vittorioromeo&#x2F;quakevr#main-features</a><p>I love VR-unique interactions, and I try to find opportunities to add more. As an example, I recently added &quot;flick reloading&quot; to the SSG -- see it in action here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uV8gbDvNYAM"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uV8gbDvNYAM</a>.<p>Here is an older trailer showcasing features like dual-wielding, holsters, and the grappling hook: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=c_ctxSqs6gA"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=c_ctxSqs6gA</a><p>---<p>Quake VR is written in modern C++ and it&#x27;s completely <i>free</i> and <i>open-source</i>: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vittorioromeo&#x2F;quakevr"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vittorioromeo&#x2F;quakevr</a>.

Vittorio<p>---<p>FAQ:<p>&gt; Is this project related to the Quake ports available for the Meta Quest?<p><pre><code>    * No, this project is separate from those. It uses a different engine and it was developed by me, Vittorio Romeo, with some very appreciated contributions by community members (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vittorioromeo&#x2F;quakevr#credits).
</code></pre>
&gt; Why is Quake VR not available on Steam?<p><pre><code>    * I&#x27;ve tried really, *really* hard to release it on Steam as a free community mod. However, that requires permission from the owners of the Quake IP.

      I have spent countless hours trying to communicate with id Software, Bethesda, Microsoft, never receiving *any* sort of response. I&#x27;ve even tried directly contacting employees, who kindly forwarded my request to the legal team, to no avail: zero answers whatsoever.

      I have not given up -- if you know someone that can help, please let me know!
</code></pre>
&gt; Is Quake VR compatible with existing Quake mods or existing Quake servers?<p><pre><code>    * No, Quake VR uses a custom protocol and engine in order to deliver first-class VR features. It is possible to adapt mods to work with Quake VR -- I have done that for the official expansions and some popular mods.
</code></pre>
&gt; How can I support the Quake VR project?<p><pre><code>    * Quake VR is FOSS, however I am more than happy to accept donations for my efforts.

      PayPal (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paypal.me&#x2F;romeovittorio) works best for me, alternatively consider purchasing &quot;Open Hexagon&quot; (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;1358090&#x2F;Open_Hexagon&#x2F;), my first commercial game on Steam.</code></pre>",story,https://vittorioromeo.info/quakevr,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
