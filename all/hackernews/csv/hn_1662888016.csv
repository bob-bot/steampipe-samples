I&#x27;m thinking of releasing a python tool kit but I don&#x27;t want to go through the folly of trying to obfuscate the code and I would like users to be able to make their own customizations.<p>My tool kit would have to be distributed with media as the other parts of the program would are too big to host. It is also of niche interest and I&#x27;m not prepared yet to simply put the software in an open source orphanage. I spent considerable time on it. I only expect to make a few bucks on it by selling it on eBay.
