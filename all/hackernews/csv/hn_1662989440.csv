Yet only 26% of those wanting to buy purpose driven brands that advocate sustainability do, with 74% indicating that they don’t know how to identify eco-friendly products.<p>Additionally, consumers who do shop sustainably spend a significant amount of time researching a product to determine if it matches up to their value preferences. We’ve found in our customer interviews that many who try, quickly give up. They become overwhelmed as they travel down a rabbit hole of unending questions.  Does the product have a low carbon footprint?  Was it manufactured using fair labor practices?  Where is it made? Who do I trust to provide the information I need to make a decision?<p>Researching and finding products that align with your value preferences is a hassle!<p>The solution -<p>Softly makes it simple to support products you believe in and shop sustainably. Tell us what you care about in a product, such as if it&#x27;s low carbon, organic, or cruelty free.

Softly.<p>Our customer interviews have shown that climate change and sustainability issues are overwhelming concepts, so our goal is to make it easier to be actively involved as a consumer.
