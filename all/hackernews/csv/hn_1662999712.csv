The daily rates and cost per miles fluctuate tremendously based on supply and demand, seasonality, day-of-week, location, and other variables.<p>TruckRentalPrices.com aims to provide a window of transparency into these black boxes, to help renters better estimate out-of-pocket costs when budgeting their move.<p>For this initial MVP, we ran tens-of-thousands of sample trip queries to the various providers quoting systems using Selenium and other libraries. We used random dates and locations as inputs. Our goal was to identify crucial metrics such as minimums, average, and maximum costs per mile and daily rates, and comparing weekend vs weekday rates.<p>For example, our data shows that a 26&#x27; Budget Box Truck in the US has the following rates:<p>Average Daily Base Rate: $105.30
Average Weekend Base Rate: $149.99
Average Cost Per Mile: $0.91
Minimum Cost Per Mile: $0.57
Maximum Cost Per Mile: $2.49<p>We also break down costs by state.<p>We display this data along side the top 6 providers in the US: U-haul, Home Depot, Hertz, Penske, Budget, and Enterprise - on a single page.<p>More providers and data will be added in the next phase. We will include a calculator that will provide cost estimates from point A to point B, and eventually opening up to more regions outside the US.<p>This site was built using the following technologies: Next.js on Vercel, Cloudfront, Lambda@Edge, S3, Route53, and DynamoDB on AWS.<p>Looking forward to your feedback, feature requests, or anything else that would be helpful.
