Working on a platform for a hedge fund felt no different from building for a retailer or a real estate company.
Everything behind the scenes is so much of the same that unless the devs intentionally made some random tech choice or decided to use a barely stable new framework - you could hardly tell them apart from code PoV.<p>I’ve tried startups - but majority of them, until a pretty late stage are mostly smoke &amp; mirrors, where you do everything to acquire customers while pretty much lying about the capabilities of your tech. Can be fun in the beginning while figuring out what the product is, but so far, all of them end up being a CRUD app, just with a different skin.
When going large corporate, you get an extremely small part of the bigger stack to work on, which might be interesting first time around, but gets old after changing the search bar for who knows how many times that year for marginal gains (yes, while the changes are marginal, I do realise they can translate into millions every month).<p>I’ve had little luck of going for roles that do not directly correlate with my current experience. It seems that recruiters have very little interest in talking about any roles other than ones that fit my current stack exactly (node&#x2F;react&#x2F;python). Even had one that was a bit more direct than others and blurted out - “Why would you want to change with so much experience in your current stack”. I get it, easy payday for them if they hire someone who can work full on from day 1, but there&#x27;s nothing in it for me to encourage a change.
Sadly, recruiters are often the gatekeepers for a lot of the roles and as far as I can tell, unless I’m an easy hire with experience in the stack being hired for - they have little interest in a “wildcard”.<p>So here’s the question - is there a way out?<p>Any experiences of a major transition and how did you pull it off?<p>Is contracting the only way - accept that I&#x27;ll be making CRUD apps and might as well maximise income from that?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32813072,Ask HN: How would you design a Modern Operating System in 2022?,2022-09-12T16:55:08Z,Decabytes,5,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Disclaimer: Thought Experiment. Does not need to be &quot;practical&quot;. Let your NIH flow and your imagination run wild<p>We&#x27;ve learned a lot about computers in the decades we&#x27;ve been producing. A lot of software assumes that computers work a certain way. See Go lang and how it handles file permissions. In the Linux Kernel drivers exist that supports the IBM 3270 Display System which at this point is over 50 years old. Terminal Emulators mimic the VT100. All of this makes sense given the context in which they were developed and created. But if you were developing an OS in 2022 without these constraints what would you remove and or change? Would you keep 32bit support? Arm, Risc and or x86?, monolithic or microkernel?, C, Rust, Zig, D, C++, or something else?, how would it talk to hardware?, what would your executable format look like?<p>Also if anyone has any interesting links to cutting edge research into Modern Operating Systems I&#x27;d love to browse them!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
