32817623,Ask HN: Should I go on sabbatical even if I'm afraid of it?,2022-09-12T22:03:42Z,gabrieledarrigo,4,false,false,1,[32817824],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello guys, I&#x27;m a 39-year old Italian software engineer with 10 years of experience, and I&#x27;m afraid of going on a sabbatical.<p>My background is quite different from my peers: even though I have a respectable and loveable family, when I was a young adult, I left my studies after secondary school and made a lot of mistakes and wrong decisions that eventually led me to commit different crimes, including a robbery, for which I spent some time in jail.<p>After that experience, I was in my 20s, finding a job was hard, and I only worked as blue-collar for small-term jobs.
I also started suffering anxiety and panic attacks, and I was afraid of many things, especially working and finding a job.
While working temporarily in a call center, I decided to go to an evening school to have more options on the table, and when I was 25, I successfully took a high school diploma in IT.<p>My goal was to work as a computer technician since every other IT-related job was unavailable to me; I had a criminal record and a barely fresh diploma, while my peers were probably coming out of university with a Master&#x27;s in CS or related. It was too late to dream of something better. My family continuously told me: just be humble and satisfied with what I achieved.<p>I was not.<p>I chose to continue studying, and during the next few years, I completed various evening professional courses in Sys Admin, Networking Configuration, and a Cisco CCNA.
When I got the first offers in the field, I was terrified to accept them, and I realized that configuring computers and networks was boring.<p>So I started to study PHP, HTML, and CSS (other evening courses), tinkering with my first websites.<p>A teacher noted my passion and offered me a job at his company: at 29 years old, scared as hell, I took my first job as a programmer for an Italian broadcaster, Radio 105.
Throughout all these years, anxiety and fear never left me.
I even had terrible impostor syndrome, constantly feeling like I was in the wrong place, doing bad things.<p>Time went on, I changed jobs, and suddenly I had the opportunity to work for eBay: me, a guy with this past, working with real software engineers!
That&#x27;s when I realized that maybe I was not so bad, and while working there, I searched for help to heal my uneasiness.
I started to do cognitive therapy and, recommended by my therapist, mindfulness. Along with some SSRIs, this helped me to be more self-confident, calm and less restless.
This new state of being enabled me to prepare for my next journey: five years ago, I decided to try for a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in CS while working as a software engineer for a startup.<p>It was extremely challenging, but I was happy, and in the end, I was successful: last April, at the age of 39, I graduated with a good vote, and my dream came true!
While studying, I realized that, from those distant years when I decided to take my first step into trying to change my life, I never stopped learning and working and that I was, in some ways, tired of giving my 100% to be successful.
So I started dreaming about a sabbatical after graduation to take some breath, rest, travel (another thing that, in some way, scares me a lot) and enjoy life. Even in Italy, where the work ethic is quite old and conservative, and things like sabbaticals are frowned upon, it couldn&#x27;t be that difficult to find another job as a programmer! That&#x27;s what I thought.<p>And now that I&#x27;m there, I&#x27;m terrified.
Anxiety, fear, and uncertainty like in the past: what if I could not get another good job? What if I&#x27;m too old to be a programmer? What if I cannot return to work and feel fatigued after a long period of rest?
My therapist told me that maybe it&#x27;s just my self-conservative side: I only discovered that this sabbatical is the wrong thing to do.
I&#x27;m not totally sold on this theory, so I&#x27;m here, asking for some advice and help.
Sorry if this post is too long, but I had this thing to say, and I hope this is the right place!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
