I am currently leading a team trying to radically accelerate cancer researchers so that we might have cures faster.<p>My undisclosed HQ location in a villa in Hawai&#x27;i was just SWOTTED by the police.

Don&#x27;t believe everything you read.<p>It&#x27;s okay, I get it. The odds of #AcceleratingTheCures are incredibly low. Only a crazy one would think we could do it.<p>Tonight I need some smiles. I dedicate tonight&#x27;s code session to Jared Hancock from Brockton, MA. Every time I think of you I smile. I miss you bro. I love you Courtney Brennan Maurice Hancock and the other hancocks who I don&#x27;t know as well. Jared, I wish you were here man. I would have called you weeks ago.
