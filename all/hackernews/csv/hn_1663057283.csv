(I know many people did!)<p>So I suspected this for a while but I finally confirmed it - I was shadow banned; to my understanding this is likely because I opened a bot (commands on @mention) account with same mail&#x2F;phone or whatever.<p>This is worst than actual banning. I&#x27;ve been living in the shadows for who knows how long.<p>Recently I gained some momentum - one of my threads (same handle, @high_byte) got relatively viral and I doubled my followers overnight. (from 300 to almost 600 lol)<p>But still I am invisible to the world. support@twitter.com auto-replies with basically &quot;we don&#x27;t answer via email&quot;. Their support page has only Q&amp;A and no contact information. This should be illegal!<p>What can I do?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
