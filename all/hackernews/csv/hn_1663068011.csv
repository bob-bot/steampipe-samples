I’m no operating systems expert and would love to know how far an program with or without root access could go reading the password managers data. This might differ on different host OS (Linux vs macOS vs Windows).<p>Let us assume a standard master-key plus master-password setup. We also assume a hosted data service by the provider (i.e, they encryptedly store everything, except master-key and master-password).<p>Obviously a malware could access the clipboard and thus get each password copied to the clipboard. But how far does it go? Can we access password in-memory when the vault is unlocked? etc.<p>Can malware access the master-key? Can malware access the master-password? How? Only via keyloggers? Can malware access all passwords when vault is unlocked? Can malware access anything in RAM? What could malware do when sniffing network connections?<p>Thanks for indulging me!

We open sourced it today under AGPLv3. It&#x27;s a standalone Kubernetes engine&#x2F;distribution that operations-wise is very much vanilla K8s (v1.24). Security-wise, it comes with some new concepts: It&#x27;s designed to shield K8s clusters as a whole from the cloud. The goal is that not even the cloud provider and its employees can access any data in a cluster. Constellation basically ensures that all nodes in a cluster (1) run inside verified &quot;Confidential VMs&quot; and (2) encrypt all network traffic and storage.<p>Confidential VMs are VMs that have the AMD SEV feature. Intel TDX and Arm Realms are similar. CVMs protect workloads against a compromised host and malicious admins. For this, CVMs remain encrypted at runtime in memory, are strongly isolated, and have cool remote attestation capabilities. This is also often referred to as &quot;confidential computing&quot;.<p>CVMs are currently available in Azure and GCP. Constellation comes with a Fedora CoreOS-based node image that is optimized for CVMs and protected with Sigstore. More info in the README&#x2F;docs.<p>What do you think?<p>-Felix",story,https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
