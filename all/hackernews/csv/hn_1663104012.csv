32829857,Ask HN: How would you spatialize higher dimensional data?,2022-09-13T20:34:19Z,anigbrowl,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I wrangle a lot of social media datasets, which could be anything from an email database to an old 4chan archive. I&#x27;m primarily interested in the metadata network dynamics rather than the content (although I might mine it for hashtags of length&#x2F;complexity, but I am not very interested in NLP). Sometimes it&#x27;s just a few thousand items, sometimes orders of magnitude larger.<p>Typically when I represent this data visually I use force-directed layouts or tree&#x2F;radial ones if it&#x27;s definitely hierarchical. And I&#x27;m pretty good at the visualization side - filtering, community detection, backbone extraction, layer decomposition, motif identification, time windowing and so on. I enjoy starting out with a giant hairball and translating it into something intuitively comprehensible and explicable. I also experiment a lot with other dataviz paradigms - treemaps, hyperbolic geometry and so on.<p>But one thing that bothers me about many layout algorithms is that they&#x27;re so arbitrary; once you go past a certain level of complexity you can get quite different outcomes from the same dataset and starting procedures. And it&#x27;s difficult to represent agents and their activity on the same graph, eg influencers and their tweets. I am constantly trying to think of ways to map the raw  data to Cartesian space or on the interior of a sphere, not unlike a planetarium. But I have some kind of cognitive or knowledge-based block to understanding this, which I can&#x27;t seem to get around.<p>How would <i>you</i> spatialize a complex network - eg suppose you had unlimited access to the HN API and plugged it into a particle system or an FPS game engine?<p>I&#x27;m more interested in creating a vivid, explorable impression than scientific modeling. I just struggle with the concept of locality because (in this example) any HN user could reply to or vote&#x2F;flag any other as there&#x27;s no &#x27;travel time&#x27; between threads or users. And without a coherent spatial metaphor, I can&#x27;t think of good mappings to 2 or 3 dimensions of space and another of time.<p>Thanks for your help!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;m trying to focus on some of my ideas and build out a company around something I can manage to build to 80% and start demoing. Here are my doubts:<p>- I don&#x27;t really understand how CI works. At work our CI process is massive and honestly confusing&#x2F;complex. In my case, I have just a few simple scripts that manage this.<p>- I keep my code organized by separation of concerns using some things I&#x27;ve learned from clean code, clean architecture, DDD, etc. Almost everything is a single responsibility, small functions that I can test easily in isolation or as part of larger integration tests, and I don&#x27;t really do anything fancy or n levels of abstraction, factories for factories, etc.<p>- If it works out of the box with std library, I use it. Otherwise for more complex things or things I don&#x27;t personally understand, I&#x27;ll use a well supported library if I don&#x27;t want to spend a whole day re-inventing the wheel.<p>When I look at other people&#x27;s code I often have a really hard time understanding what is going on. The tests are confusing, and I feel like I am stupid for not understanding what they&#x27;re doing in the source code. I also find a lot of the &quot;support&quot; projects like CI, infra, etc. are also complex. At work we have entire teams for all of this, like there&#x27;s a dozen engineers who work on CI related things, like 30 in infra, etc who support all the teams. Maybe that&#x27;s why it is complex?<p>At work I&#x27;m considered pretty good and I get put on greenfield projects which I hammer out foundations that other people then pick up and build on top of. When I look at external projects or work other people do, I often times just get overwhelmed by the complexity in these projects from the libraries they use to how they structure their code or tests.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
