When contracting for Celsius in 2019, a recently bankrupt crypto-lending platform, I quickly observed how important it was for every Web3 company to establish credibility and trust in a high-risk industry where fraud and scams are becoming increasingly common.<p>As I continued to invest and build in the space, it became clear that existing tools are still not enough to effectively evaluate credibility. Common issues that keep coming up include:
1. Repeat scammers are rarely held accountable
2. Anonymous contributors can’t easily establish credibility
3. Project and contributor success metrics are mostly based on historic financial performance<p>We built Fide to help users verify web3 credibility and only invest in projects and teams they can trust. We’re still adding features and projects but would welcome any feedback as we continue building!",story,https://www.fide.id/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
