32833229,Ask HN: Good resource to learn about audio streaming?,2022-09-14T04:06:44Z,graderjs,3,false,false,1,[32833421],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I have a remote browser app that needs to stream audio and after wrestling with this for many years I finally got the latency down for the audio to around 1 second. The main way to that I reduced like 5 seconds of lag was basically renicing the MP3 encoding process. but no matter what priority or what kind of different processes in the pipeline reniced I couldn&#x27;t get the leg beyond 2 seconds. I discovered that most of the lag was due to actually encoding using lame on the server into MP3 and that if I used wave format even though it&#x27;s a lot more bandwidth that brought the latency down to under 1 second.<p>The problem then is the wave format is a lot of bandwidth so when your bandwidth drops, the audio can become delayed or gappy. I tried downsampling it to 20KHz but that introduced comparable lag to MP3 encoding.<p>My idea now is that somehow I can air quotes break the audio stream into little pieces and stream it over webRTC to the browser but I don&#x27;t understand anything about how audio is streamed in a way that is able to respond to changing bandwidth conditions.<p>My plan is to use pulseaudio RTP source to send it over the network and I want to pick it up with webrtc in the browser but maybe that&#x27;s not possible, or wouldn&#x27;t give me the low latency streaming that I want.<p>Anyway I know I simply do not understand enough about this and I couldn&#x27;t really find any good resources where I can learn about it so I&#x27;m just asking here if anyone can point me in the right direction or give me some advice about this that would be awesome.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
