In order to continue I needed to agree to my personal data being shared out side of the EU.<p>My immediate thought was WOW my TV overnight became the TV from 1984 (to my knowledge it might have already been for a while).  So when did my TV start watching(listening) to me?<p>So in the shower I started to think about what could have a big impact that all us where we wake up overnight to find new T&amp;Cs that significantly affects us.  I kept thinking about AI and how pretty much all AI models are trained on NVIDIA hardware.<p>If NVIDIA decided to push a T&amp;C update that said it was against their wishes to train AI for XYZ it would significantly affect the future.<p>This leaves me with some thoughts.
- Why isn&#x27;t there significant competition in this space like AMD?
- Why doesn&#x27;t AI ethical groups push for decentralisation for compute power?
- Should someone like an AI developer avoid using NVIDIA?
- What are the alternatives?
- Does this even matter?<p>I&#x27;m pretty much a noob for this sort of thing but I tried to do some research on this before posting but google just gave me clickbaity articles so I would much appreciate your brainpower on this.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
