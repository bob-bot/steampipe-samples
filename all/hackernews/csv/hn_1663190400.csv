In 3 months, we&#x27;ve built an MVP and a small community of enthusiasts and are looking for more iOS beta testers. We would love if you could try to break our app, or give any insight for things that should&#x2F;shouldn&#x27;t be included pre&#x2F;post launch. We&#x27;re launching in the United States and have a primary focus on Southern California for beta testing, but we encourage you to try it out even if you&#x27;re not in our area.<p>As residents of Southern California, we created Kotse because we find ourselves having to adjust&#x2F;cancel plans all the time when we can&#x27;t find parking. This happens when we do trips to big cities (LA, SD, SF), beaches, or big events. When we went on other platforms such as Facebook&#x2F;Craigslist&#x2F;Neighbor and other C2C parking apps such as Prked&#x2F;Parkstash, we found that booking and listing spots wasn&#x27;t as streamline as it should be, and oftentimes felt unsafe. We&#x27;re primarily addressing safety and a smoother experience with liability protection and a more intuitive, modern design.<p>Feel free to comment here, or hit me up at jan@kotse.app if you have any questions&#x2F;comments&#x2F;concerns.
