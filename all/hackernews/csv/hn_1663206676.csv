The current approach to me seems really archaic, single queue, First in First out, huge waits, a lot of stress on the transport network as people pile into London unplanned etc.<p>I feel like it would have made way more sense to have a website ready where you could have registered and then received a QR code and an allocated slot to go view the queen. I brought this up on Reddit but it got a bit of push back, people saying how it would be unsuitable for the elderly etc but I still think there would be ways round it like a standard queue run alongside the allocated system.<p>Obviously you can’t scale it horizontally like you would in a traditional computer science way by adding duplicate queens in duplicate Westminster halls so I was just wondering what the big brains of HN would come up with if it was under their control?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
