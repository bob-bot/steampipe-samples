32847497,Ask HN: Any real US alternatives to Starbucks for a place to work/study?,2022-09-15T05:36:27Z,readonthegoapp,2,false,false,1,[32847722],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I wanted to try a new chain to do some work&#x2F;study&#x2F;chill at, but realized that Starbucks is about it in Atlanta as far as chains go.<p>But then I looked a bit deeper and realized that there did not seem to be any real alternatives to Starbucks - for the type of sit-down-for-hours place I was looking for.<p>So, &#x27;real&#x27; in this case means a place with nice, comfortable furniture and an atmosphere that says, &quot;Welcome - stay a while.&quot; -- i.e. a real third place.<p>When I check out Caribou Coffee, for instance, which may be the biggest somewhat-like-Starbucks coffee chain in the US, and it&#x27;s eh -- I really don&#x27;t even want to go in. In terms of potential work space welcome, I&#x27;d give Starbucks a 6 or 7 and Caribou a 2 or 3. Why? The cheaper, less-comfortable-seeming furniture, seemingly-smaller&#x2F;tighter footprints, etc. -- the whole vibe is more fast food than I&#x27;d prefer.<p>A place like Panera Bread is interesting-ish, but doesn&#x27;t quite feel right - like when the lunch rush comes, you feel in the way -- because you probably _are_ in the way -- they do things like set timers on the wifi, etc.<p>I do have some smaller cafes that I go to -- some might even qualify as small chains (e.g., Dancing Goats) -- but I was kind of surprised to find out that there are no very direct Starbucks competitors for a &#x27;third place&#x27; in the US.<p>Maybe places like Caribou or Philz or whatever will just take 10 more years to try to grab some market share? Or maybe Starbucks has already reached an Amazon-level of super-dominance that can now never really be challenged.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
