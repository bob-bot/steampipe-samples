As the reason, Twitter gave a vague formula: your account broke the Twitter Rules. What rules exactly? It is not known.<p>We have already sent several appeals, but we are not getting any reply. Twitter Support also does not respond to us. We have the impression that for several days our efforts have only fallen into the abyss of algorithms. Several months of work on Twitter thus go to the trash. Is there any chance to get our Twitter account back? Is the only option to create a new account and start building a community from scratch? Do you have any experiences with similar situations?<p>Personally, it is hard for us to imagine breaking any Twitter Rules. Our game is a socially engaged project that we have been working on for 8 years (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;2094580&#x2F;Ticket_to_Europe&#x2F;). We invest private savings in it and create it out of a sense of mission - it&#x27;s a Text-Based RPG about refugees. The scenario was based on real stories of refugees we met during our research in a refugee camp. We are supported by various human rights volunteers and various NGOs consulted the scenario. We do not promote racist behavior in any way, on the contrary - our project was created precisely to increase social awareness and sensitivity to the drama that refugees face. How can such ideals conflict with Twitter&#x27;s principles? Dunno.<p>Will publicizing such a case in the media increase our chances of recovering the account? Please help us, we are emotionally broken and a little desperate.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

    - IMO, Meta itself is evil, and I don&#x27;t think it should be grouped together with the others. But this is purely subjective, and others might have different valid opinions.
    - It doesn&#x27;t include Microsoft, which is bigger and more powerful than at least three other companies listed.
