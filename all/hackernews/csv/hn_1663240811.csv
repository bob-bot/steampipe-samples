Now I have about four items on my to-do list every day. But when I started my bootstrapped startup Proxies API, I only had two things on my to-do list for months.<p>a) Make the product better every day<p>b) Write every day<p>The reason for this is:<p>a) I believe a startup, in the beginning, is nothing but the sum of the founder’s habits.<p>b) Habits are the dependable assets of the startup.<p>c) Even if the startup fails, I take home these habits, so they can’t hurt in the next startup or job.<p>So for months, this is all I did. I refused to even explain in the to-do list what I was going to write. It didn’t matter what I wrote. I just wrote today, that’s a more significant takeaway in the whole scheme of things than what I wrote. It also didn’t matter how good it was. Time will fix that anyway. I focus on not breaking the habit no matter what. That’s the deal with myself.<p>I am not allowed to read about the latest marketing growth hack on medium or Twitter. Put my head down and show me after 100 days that I have not broken the streak of writing every single day. That&#x27;s what I need.<p>It is no surprise that Proxies API went on to be my first successful startup. It is a huge relief. But this secret was never in building a startup, and the secret is making a couple of simple habits.<p>The author is the founder of Proxies API, a proxy rotation api service.<p>This article originally appeared here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.proxiesapi.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;Why-I-Only-Have-2-Items-On-My-To-do-List-Every-Day.php",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
