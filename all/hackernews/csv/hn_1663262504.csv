My startup uses Stripe Connect to accept payments on behalf of our clients, and when I looked into it, I found that Stripe had decided to deactivate her account. Reason listed: &#x27;Other&#x27;.<p>Great.<p>I contact Stripe via chat, and I learn nothing. Frontline support says &quot;we&#x27;ll look into it.&quot; Days go by, still nothing. Meanwhile, this customer is losing a massive amount of business and suffering.<p>After a few days, my team and I go at them from as many angles as possible. We&#x27;re on the phone, we&#x27;re on Twitter, we&#x27;re reaching out to connections who work there &#x2F; used to work there, and of course, we reach out to patio11. All of these support channels give us nothing except &quot;we&#x27;ve got a team looking into it&quot;. But Stripe&#x27;s frontline seems to be prohibited from offering any other info, I assume for liability reasons. &quot;We wouldn&#x27;t want to accidentally tell you the reason this happened, and have it be a bad one.&quot;<p>We ask:
1. Why was this account flagged?
&quot;I don&#x27;t have that information&quot;
2. What can we do to get this fixed?
&quot;I don&#x27;t have access to that information.
3. Who does?
&quot;I don&#x27;t have access to that information&quot;
4. What can you do about this?
&quot;I&#x27;ve escalated your case. It&#x27;s being reviewed.&quot;<p>I should mention at this point that I&#x27;ve been running this business since 2016, my customers have been more or less the same since then, and I&#x27;ve had (back when it was apparently possible) several phone conversations with Stripe staff about my business model. They know exactly who our customers are and what services we offer, and have approved it as such.<p>After a week of templated email responses and endless anxiety, we finally got an email from Stripe letting us know that they had reviewed the account and reactivated it. We never got a reason for why any of this had happened, despite asking for one multiple times. Oh well, still good news right? Except nope, this was only the beginning.<p>This morning I woke up to an email that about 35% of my client accounts had been deactivated and were &quot;Under review&quot;, the kicker here being that one of those accounts is the same one they already reviewed last week! This is either the work of incompetent staff or (more likely) a bad algorithm. No reasonable human could make this mistake after last week&#x27;s drama.<p>So currently, my product doesn&#x27;t work for 35% of my customers. Cue torrent of pissed off customer emails.<p>And the best part is, this time I have an email from Stripe this time: Apparently these accounts are being flagged, despite the notes on our file, and despite the review completed literally last week, as not in compliance with Stripe&#x27;s ToS. They suggest that if I believe this was done in error, I should reach out to customer support. Oh, you mean the same customer support that can&#x27;t give me literally any information at all other than &quot;We have a team looking into it&quot;? The same customer support that won&#x27;t give me any estimates as to how long it&#x27;s going to take to put this fire out? The same customer support that literally looked into this a week ago and found no issues!?<p>I feel like I&#x27;m going crazy over here. These accounts have hundreds of thousands of dollars in them being held hostage by an utterly incompetent team &#x2F; algorithm that seems to lack any and all empathy for the havoc they wreak on businesses when they pull the rug out from under them with no warning, nor for the impact they have on customers when they all of a sudden lose all ability to make money. And all that for an account that has been using Stripe for nearly 7 years without issue!<p>This goes so far beyond &quot;customer support declining at scale.&quot; If lack of customer support means that critical integrations start to fail, that&#x27;s not a customer support failure, that&#x27;s a fundamental business failure.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32854746,Launch HN: Signadot (YC W20) – Lightweight Test Environments for Microservices,2022-09-15T16:47:06Z,jaguar75,12,false,false,2,[32855075],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey everyone, we’re Arjun and Anirudh, founders of Signadot (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.signadot.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.signadot.com&#x2F;</a>). Signadot is a Kubernetes-based solution that enables lightweight environments, called Sandboxes, to test microservices early in the development lifecycle.<p>Before founding Signadot, I managed engineering teams building microservices at different companies. As the number of services and external dependencies (i.e databases, message queues, third-party APIs, etc) increased, testing became challenging. While at a smaller scale, we could stand up our “application in a box”, as the complexity increased, we relied on a pre-production (staging) environment to do a lot of our testing. However since the staging environment was shared by many teams for testing, it became a bottleneck. When issues were discovered on staging, the root-cause analysis took a long time.<p>We talked to many companies about how they were testing their microservices, especially once they started to grow beyond ~20 engineers. We encountered various solutions ranging from companies setting up multiple (expensive) staging environments, to having each team take turns “locking” the staging environment. At larger companies, like Uber and Lyft, we learned that they had built their own highly scalable (but bespoke) solution for testing microservices based on dynamic traffic routing. With this kind of system, environments can spin up quickly, and are cost-effective at scale. We wanted to build a similar system that was more generalized and make it available to everyone running on Kubernetes.<p>The intuition behind Sandboxes is that each test environment only has a few microservices under test and all other dependencies can be fulfilled from a shared pool of microservices running the latest version called the *baseline*. Starting with a staging Kubernetes cluster running up-to-date stable versions of microservices, sandbox environments are described in terms of what is modified with respect to the baseline. This is similar to the copy-on-write model of resource management. Once a sandbox environment is set up, tests can be run against it and requests get routed to the versions of microservices under test.<p>An important consideration is isolation between different sandbox environments. For isolating test requests, we use traffic labeling and request routing. With traffic labeling, a tenant ID is set as an L7 header on each HTTP&#x2F;gRPC request and based on the value of this header, requests follow different paths through the microservices. Request routing is realized by working with a service mesh (like Istio) if already installed, or by using our sidecar proxies. For tests that require data isolation, we built a pluggable framework called Resources (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.signadot.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;sandbox-resources"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.signadot.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;sandbox-resources</a>) that can set up an ephemeral stateful resource (Kafka topic, database schema, etc) on the fly and tie it to the sandbox lifecycle. Resources can also be used to test when there is async communication across services.<p>We worked with a few enterprise companies for over a year to come up with an architecture that can support complex microservice environments. We built a Kubernetes Operator that installs into our users’ Kubernetes clusters and connects to a control plane that we host. Our control plane acts as both an API to create sandbox environments and as a proxy layer that can route traffic to sandboxes.<p>We are launching with support for integration &amp; end-to-end testing by providing high-fidelity environments that can be set up via the CI pipeline. Next on our roadmap is making it easy to write custom resource plugins and enabling feature testing using sandboxes. With feature testing, developers working on different microservices can see how their changes interact with each other’s services before merging.<p>If you’d like to try it out, we have a free tier. Our pricing is based on the number of unique services in sandboxes.<p>Thanks for reading this post and we welcome your feedback and comments!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
