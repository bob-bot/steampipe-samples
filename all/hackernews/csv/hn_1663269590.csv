I&#x27;m a one-person-shop, not a developer, and I integrate with Stripe through my invoicing software.  I&#x27;ve been building momentum towards a new product launch that will hopefully change that transaction velocity to dozens, hopefully a couple hundred transactions per day, through a storefront.<p>Now, I am concerned that a significant change in velocity&#x2F;volume like this is going to set off a flag with Stripe, and I fear that my Stripe account will get nuked, kill the launch, all the momentum I&#x27;ve been building, my reputation, and all my regular business to boot -- if I lose access to Stripe I lose a very significant portion of my business. Even if its just for a couple weeks while I&#x27;m &quot;being reviewed&quot;.<p>There seem to be many threads here on HN about getting killed by Stripe without explanation, without easy recourse, without customer support or quick resolution -- especially as a small fry like me.<p>Are there any suggestions for a non developer, one-person-shop to avoid this seemingly common pitfall?<p>Why do I think I&#x27;ll get flagged? In recent history had one invoice that was unusually large for my transaction history -- I landed a really good project.  I feared this would set off a trigger with Stripe, and sure enough I was flagged &quot;as a part of our ongoing account review process&quot;.<p>Stripe sent very vague and *very &quot;phishy&quot;* seeming emails. After logging into Stripe I had to give access to my bank accounts and get through a &quot;review&quot; of my business.<p>I really feared I was going to be cut off then. So, I harbor no illusions that it will happen again next time should I enjoy a modicum of unusual success.
