Some focus a lot on CloudFormation - if CSA-P is 20-30% CF knowledge, then I do not want to take it.<p>Similarly, I was recommended Adrian Cantrill&#x27;s course on CSA-A - I notice he has one on CSA-P, and it seems to be quite bespoke to the exam, as opposed to the ACloudGuru one which didn&#x27;t seem entirely inspired by what was actually asked in the exam.<p>My two questions are:<p><pre><code>  - CSA-P - Is it as heavy in CloudFormation crap as some sites make it seem?

  - Is Adrian Cantrill&#x27;s course enough to get me through the exam? Is there a cheaper alternative?

</code></pre>
P.S.<p>I know that certification isn&#x27;t absolutely necessary to getting work with cloud architecture, but I imagine that getting through the door is easiest when I have it.

32858144,Ask HN: Is avoiding unpaid career prep/learning a viable path when unemployed?,2022-09-15T20:39:35Z,spearingthehead,2,false,false,1,[32858411],<null>,<null>,<null>,"About 2 years ago I joined a fairly well-known prep program for software engineers on job interviews. At the time I had been one year without a job and with some 8 years of experience, and this program was recommended to me so I gave it a shot. I did the several weeks-long course and the longer follow-up portion which mainly involves applying to jobs, attending one weekly meeting and checking in with my progress.<p>A year later, still no job offers. Therefore, I ceased doing my follow-up at the end of last year, and this year I really decreased my output for job applications, mainly limiting myself to recruiters. To meet a weekly quota with the interview prep program, I had sent nearly a thousand applications last year. My ratio of applications to interviews was still pretty low with the interview program, so I stopped mass-sending applications.<p>But I also decided to stop doing things towards helping my career on unpaid time, even as I&#x27;m still unemployed. Taking that prep course didn&#x27;t do anything to net me a job offer and I feel I&#x27;ve put in too much of my free time already for not getting any jobs out of it, so why would I want to keep going when it all feels like a gamble? I want to avoid unpaid career building from here on out. Could this still be a viable path? I&#x27;m not going to sign up to anything or do any career-related practice <i>unless</i> a company is paying for it, or otherwise doing it on salaried time. I only make an exception for meetup groups since I count that as socializing and not strictly career-related matters.<p>A job can hire me and pay me to learn, I have no problem with that. On-the-job training is a real thing. But I don&#x27;t consider job searching to be a job, because I&#x27;m not getting paid for it.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
