Why aren&#x27;t companies and developers not interested in benchmarking Docker? And how come we never talk about it too much on HN?<p>Google Image search yields a few more graphs, one of which led me to this article: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scylladb.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;09&#x2F;cost-containerization-scylla&#x2F;<p>Performance impact straight out of box seems significant.<p>Ofcourse, with any performance discussion, there is always &quot;take results with a grain of salt&quot; and flaws in benchmarking process. But, I am just generally curious about the following:<p>1) Has your company conducted docker performance tests with your specific work load?<p>2) If yes, what is the performance hit approximately?<p>3) If no, is it because AWS&#x2F;cloud resources are cheap and it is not worth the time or is that no one questions it?<p>4) Is the ease of development preferred vs. cost of performance in terms of ROI?<p>Thank you.<p>PS - Does your company <i>not</i> use Docker? Why? Would love to hear that.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
