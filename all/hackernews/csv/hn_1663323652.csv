32864199,Show HN: Indicator Dash – Rank and compare to mitigate crypto market uncertainty,2022-09-16T10:00:35Z,jldevezas,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"For the last two years, I have been hard at work to launch Indicator Dash, along with its parent company, Hex Datum OÜ (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdatum.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdatum.com&#x2F;</a>). Before that, I was an academic for over 10 years, a career that culminated with my PhD thesis, entitled &quot;Graph-Based Entity-Oriented Search&quot;, successfully defended in 2021. More about me here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;josedevezas.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;josedevezas.com&#x2F;</a><p>Now, a bit about Indicator Dash.<p>Indicator Dash is a crypto analytics product where we provide normalized signals, ready to be combined by the user in a personalized manner to support learning or decision-making through rankings.<p>I believe this approach to be a middle ground between raw indicators and algorithmic trading approaches. Here, users only need to understand what the indicator represents, but the interpretation process is already done, in the backstage, by Indicator Dash, resulting in specific signals extracted from multiple indicator statistics or configurations. This enables regular users to create custom pair ranking solutions, at the distance of a click, without the need to learn about algorithmic trading and implement their own script. Of course, this comes at a cost: only indicator interpretations implemented by us are supported, but we plan to keep expanding our indicator signals for a long time!<p>We also collect, categorize, classify, and index crypto news articles, extracting and organizing entities into a knowledge graph. All this content is available through our search engines, or through beautiful ego network visualizations, that let you explore crypto contexts, to learn about new actors in the field and discover new coins.<p>If you&#x27;d like to test Indicator Dash, you can sign up for a free account, or use the coupon, specifically created for Hacker News, to get a 50% discount on basic or premium accounts until October 2022. The coupon can only be redeemed 10 times, so get it while it&#x27;s fresh!
