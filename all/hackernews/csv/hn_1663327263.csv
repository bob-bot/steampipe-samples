There are several best practices that I learned from old timers, e.g. gold plated contacts for communication signals less than 5VDC, no gold on signals greater than 100V, use nickel or stainless when dealing with salt exposure, look at the galvanic series and stay within 4 when mixing metals within a humid environment, etc; but aside from a 3-pg section of &quot;Electromagnetic Compatibility Engineering&quot; by Henry Ott where he discusses galvanic noise, I have been unable to find a proper textbook or even certificate on this topic.<p>This is maddening, because I make million dollar decisions based on metallurgical considerations everyday which directly affect the reliability&#x2F;expected lifetime of the products my employer manufactures.<p>Would you have any recommendations for material, coursework, or industry groups which directly deal with metallurgical considerations for electrical&#x2F;electronic assemblies (wire harnesses, PCBAs, even motors and fans)?<p>Thanks,
