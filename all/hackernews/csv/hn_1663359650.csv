He has a problem that someone must have solved already, at least in pieces, and it&#x27;s way too hard for their resources:<p>They have a need to weigh their food, but weighing each individual item is much too much trouble. So they&#x27;d like to estimate it from a photo. For example, if they filled up a palette with all drinks, it&#x27;d be 1,600 pounds, which is too much, but bread is much lighter. You get the idea.<p>So it&#x27;s basically a machine vision problem for packages, where the packages can be grouped into one of a small number of categories. They can give a weight range for each category.<p>This is not an organization with money to spend, so it needs to be a free app, which I can probably customize for them if it&#x27;s not too much work.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
