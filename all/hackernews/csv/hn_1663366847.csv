Today my gf wanted to upgrade her flight on a major commercial airline. She wasn’t able to do so online, so immediately googled the airline, in the sponsored google results there was a toll free number to call. She called the number and gave the “agent” her booking reference number and her last name. The &quot;agent&quot; asked for additional flight details like flight number and destination, but those weren’t really necessary.<p>After she gave the details the “agent” hung up immediately. It was soon apparent that this was a scammer. Immediately panic set in, what could they possibly do with that information? Upon further investigation, they can do quite a bit. They can add food to the flight, change the seat, pay for an upgrade, all of which require payment and make life better. However, they can <i>also</i> cancel the flight without verifying any further information. Evidently the scam is to cancel the reservation and resell the travel voucher since it’s only a 13 digit code and transferable. Be vigilant out there, and be sure to use ad-blockers to block sponsored Google ads.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
