But we also sometimes forget what&#x27;s on the list when we&#x27;re trying to put the order in (because it&#x27;s out of sight, meaning it&#x27;s often out of mind as well).<p>I thought I just might make this simple extension to see if it&#x27;s of any use to myself and others. Originally I wanted to have a shared sync functionality so that we could both just put in the same &quot;list key&quot; and we&#x27;d sync each other&#x27;s list online, but it seems I&#x27;ll have to make my own service to support that, which will come soon.<p>If it interests you, try it out and let me know what you think! This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever &quot;released&quot; something so I hope you enjoy and&#x2F;or share some feedback.",story,https://zukini.io,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
