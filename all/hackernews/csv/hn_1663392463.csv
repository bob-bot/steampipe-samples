This is not unlike how many web applications need persistent storage.<p>On the storage side, there are often clear and easy paths to databases and even cloud storage systems via plugins, and ORMs and such to simplify persistence.<p>But on the user auth side, the user of the framework is left with the task of integrating whatever external auth module.  This is especially challenging when framework and external module versions shift, documentation and guides become out of date, and StackOverflow questions and answers become stale.<p>Why are we still reinventing this wheel so often?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
