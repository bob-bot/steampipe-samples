We recently graduated college and have been getting more into crypto &#x2F; web3 over the past year.<p>A few of our friends had been getting into crypto more recently, but we noticed that it was hard to actually see what they were doing or natively engage with the transactions they were committing. Products like blockchain.com and etherscan.com were too technical, and products like Context or Zerion lacked key features that make modern products social, such as descriptions, likes, and comments.<p>We built WalletWatch as an easier, more social, and more fun way to see and engage with your friends’ Ethereum activity. We don’t ask for your email or password, and instead authenticate by asking users to sign a transaction with their Ethereum wallet; we ask for usernames to give a more familiar and user-friendly experience for people that haven’t purchased ENS or other crypto domain names. At the moment, we’re storing user data in Firebase instead of on-chain because the current decentralized channels are too expensive or slow.<p>We consider WalletWatch as pre-alpha. The website only renders in a mobile viewport and isn’t totally visually or computationally optimized, because we wanted to see if people liked this thing enough for us to spend more time making it polished.<p>We’d love any feedback you all have!",story,https://walletwatch-frontend.vercel.app/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
