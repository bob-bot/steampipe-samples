  - uses a queue so you can queue up multiple images without waiting for your other batches to come back

  - no need for a webserver (uses sockets to communicate)

  - clean code

  - active development (i want to use this tool myself)

  - uses stablediffusiond and stablediffusion as separate repos, these can be swapped out as desired with some hacking

The Bad<p><pre><code>  - currently relies on rabbitmq and doesn&#x27;t provide another option

  - plugin only does txt2txt. img2img works but is disabled

  - must acquire the model manually

The ugly<p><pre><code>  - not all of the features work yet. in fact you can only generate an image.

  - installation is somewhat involved (requires CUDA 11.3, rabbitmq and more) - there is an installation file and instructions but likely need improvement,

32882280,"Show HN: Thanks to SMC, firefighters with iPhones can track stairs climbed (OSS)",2022-09-17T22:37:21Z,saamerm,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN! After months of work and over 1000 hours of research, design &amp; development, I just released SMC, an open-source &amp; free iPhone fitness game for firefighters, hikers, tower-runners and people who want to become fit by climbing stairs with friends
- The app can also measure and track stairs climbed on a StairMill&#x2F;StairMaster machine. Earlier users using stair stepper exercise machines would have to use&#x2F;purchase more expensive machines that pair with their phones, now they simply wear their Apple Watch (or keep their phone in their pocket) using instructions in the app while exercising.
- Firefighters across the world regularly wear heavy weights&#x2F;their suits+hose reels) while using the stair mill &#x2F; stair master machine in their fire stations, as climbing stairs is a critical part of their job. There is no central place where the exercise is tracked, requiring them all to be self-motivated and self-disciplined, SMC hopes to improve that. 
- SMC is open-source, safe to use and doesn’t have its own database&#x2F;backend, so we collect 0 data&#x2F;analytics from users on our servers. The app uses the secure HealthKit and in-built hardware to deliver the floors&#x2F;storeys&#x2F;flights of stairs climbed by the user.
- The app also deeply integrates with GameCenter to encourage friends to be fit together, and it’s all meticulously translated  in &gt;10 languages (Includes Arabic, Ukrainian, Chinese Simplified &amp; Traditional, Spanish, French, German, Slovak...) so you can compete &amp; hold accountable your friends remotely, or just complete globally.
- The app was designed to make a low impact exercise more exciting, to encourage people to take the stairs rather than the elevator, and so I can provide my kid a game that require exercising to get achievements for me.<p>We&#x27;d love to get your feedback, and for you to share it with your friends :) We plan to add more features to the app if we get some traction &amp; interest to enhance the fun experience.",story,https://stairmasterclimber.com/app,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
