32884059,How are you handling infra/services/networking delivery with 100 silos/teams?,2022-09-18T03:08:21Z,BaconPackets,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey good folks!<p>My $job recently made some large scale cloud commitments - the usual big main clouds (3 of them, just because one wasn&#x27;t enough!), big contracts and plenty of buzzwords.<p>Working within the cloud practice for about a month, we are faced with plenty of cloud&#x2F;staffing&#x2F;knowledge&#x2F;flexibility&#x2F;technical issues. Both due to our scale and the hard questions that such a large technical undertaking is forcing us to face.<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear about other folks how they are approaching infra delivery at scale?<p>- Do you deliver &quot;empty&quot; projects in the cloud providers and let the service team figure out the rest? Do you run this as a professional service and assist teams to design &#x2F; deliver their services.
- Do you have a happy&#x2F;default path where everything runs in EKS&#x2F;GKE&#x2F;Openshift? What if a service team wants a FAT VM running Windows 2000 because some obscure business requirement?
- How do you manage the vast technical domain of 500+ different services across cloud providers?
- Do you enable all of the APIs of the cloud providers? Or do you restrict and have &quot;safe&#x2F;default&quot; enabled?
- Do you have a cloud placement matrix for the cloud providers?
- How do you manage costs when you don&#x27;t deliver the underlying services?
- How do you deal with teams that are just starting their cloud journey &#x2F; early maturity level?
- How do you treat day 2 operations? Managed services &#x2F; SRE? Push the ownership to the service teams?
- Do you have a community of practice for the cloud? How is that effort structured?<p>I&#x27;ve had some interesting discussions with a couple of friends, but curious to expand my perspective.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Now based on the market needs, the development  picked up momentum , and hence new codes are written daily by a team of developers.
We find manual testing of the software very time consuming.
The off the shelf regression testing software don’t support CAD OPERATIONS( pick points, zoom etc).
Looking for some advice&#x2F; suggestion, other than writing our own testing framework.
Thank you in advance for any suggestions.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
