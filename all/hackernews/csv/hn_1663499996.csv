32886475,Ask HN: How was your move back to India?,2022-09-18T11:07:52Z,itsmorbintime,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I’ve been living abroad for about five or six years now and I’m wondering whether returning back to India and living in Bangalore makes sense.<p>One of the biggest motivator of the move is that in India I don’t need a visa to do anything and that makes running a startup easier. Also from the outside looking in it seems like something special is brewing back in Bangalore. If I want to sell B2B SaaS it seems like a nice place where I’ll have possible customers all around me. The weather in Bangalore is quite nice too. The worries about a possible move back to India are inefficiencies in daily life - the traffic, long queues at airports, pollution, not enough green spaces, comparably worse infrastructure. All this said it seems like a good place to chase outsized out comes - alumni from college are in startups around the city and in VC, unicorns seem fairly frequent. I’d not move back with the intent of working for someone else.<p>The other options for me would be to live in cities like London, Toronto or East&#x2F;West coast. The first two I could get residence or a startup visa even. The US seems like a different beast all together where residence&#x2F;visa seems incredibly tough to navigate. For startup operators who have worked both in London&#x2F;Toronto and Bangalore, how do they compare? The best thing I love about living abroad is that the basics mostly simply work &amp; people around you generally don’t care about what you’re doing allowing you to operate. Through years of living abroad I’ve some networks in these cities (mostly alums from bigtech jobs).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
