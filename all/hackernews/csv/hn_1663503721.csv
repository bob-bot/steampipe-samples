32886788,Ask HN: How do you cope/work with endless cycle of webdev?,2022-09-18T11:58:33Z,0dayz,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve recently started to dabble in webdev (front&#x2F;backend) and it&#x27;s very much making me genuinely want to jump off and do _any_ other work because of the &quot;endless cycle of webdev&quot; and this is despite loving the concept of it (it makes me understand previous hypes such as having open APIs like in early 2010s).<p>There are 2 problems I have personally with it and 1 is a subjective observation:<p>1: It harms the ability to learn the concepts of webdev (routing, API routing, hydration, SSG&#x2F;SSR, templating, etc.) - due to:<p>- The frequency of concepts being reinvented or considered obsolete (Example: REST API -&gt; GraphQL -&gt; trpc)<p>- There is no well established &quot;timeless book&quot;&#x2F;webdoc that explains these concepts (haven&#x27;t found it at least)<p>2: it&#x27;s demoralizing:<p>- Making you second guess the stack&#x2F;libs you&#x27;ve chosen and forcing you to relearn and thus never making that &quot;prefect&quot; stable code<p>- Being told years later that the entire concept&#x2F;tool has been a disaster for the web<p>Subjective:<p>3: Established &quot;old&quot; frameworks are considered harmful&#x2F;bug-riddled&#x2F;slow with the only option being to move over to the new trendy framework thus causing the cycle to occur once more.<p>----<p>2, It&#x27;s partially why I refuse to use&#x2F;learn Typescript (the main reason is that Microsoft controls it - in contrast with say Go or Rust where it&#x27;s controlled by a foundation), due to the fate of coffescript and other web trends that now has tons of &quot;x was a mistake&quot; (like SPA).<p>3, this is mostly a rebuttable to the response &quot;just keep using what you like&quot;,
because I&#x27;ve been burnt before using what was seen once as well-established and polished but when I tried it, it was in total decay (meteorJS).<p>Essentially I&#x27;m conflicted on what to do, I do like the ideas of webapps - that webapps can connect other services together or able to create 1 platform for &quot;every&quot; device.<p>But the ecosystem is all over the place and where it&#x27;s very much &quot;chase the unicorn&quot; make huge claims with almost zero long-term plans.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;m not against moving to new tech or new stuff, I very much welcome it, if it is swapping out 1 small library (lets say something the size of sentry.io or prisma.io) not the entire workbench.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
