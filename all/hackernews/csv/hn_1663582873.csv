32896299,Ask HN: Name 3-5 books that had the most impact on your career and knowledge?,2022-09-19T09:59:49Z,dondraper36,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Even though there are literally thousands of books on software engineering, not many are really useful or career changing. That said, let&#x27;s try and name the books that you consider to be important in your career, how you understand the field, your current skills and depth of knowledge.<p>Let me start:<p>1. Designing Data Intensive Applications
This book doesn&#x27;t need any additional praise, but it&#x27;s just brilliant how it manages to be both highly technical and very readable (and even capturing).<p>2. The Pragmatic Programmer
I wish I had read it years ago. It reads like a great conversation with an incredibly experienced friend of yours<p>3. Philosophy of Software Design
It&#x27;s debatable whether this book is the better replacement for Clean Code, but I really like how nuanced and undogmatic it is.<p>It goes without saying that with such books it&#x27;s often the case that you revisit some parts or delay until you have a usecase that includes the topic discussed in the book. This is especially true for DDIA.<p>What are your top 3-5? Please, also add your brief comments on how exactly this book changed you :)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
