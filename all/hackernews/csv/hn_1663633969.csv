This, of course, is not enough - you also need to manually submit a ticket to them if they are your registrar, and so far, after more than 3 calendar days, they have not updated our domain putting our email delivery at risk. If you&#x27;re using decent domain registrars (they don&#x27;t seem to be one!), this feature is built right into the interface, and you can do this yourself. Not with Cloudflare! After submitting an urgent-level request, 2-3 hours later, there was no response. Then I reached a general support team member on chat and they promised that this will be escalated (although priority was already &quot;urgent&quot;). It didn&#x27;t get escalated - it got de-escalated to &quot;high&quot;. And more than 72 hours later, the issue still exist and MxToolbox gives us a bunch of warnings and our email ends up in spam! So, the moral of the story is that you shouldn&#x27;t use Cloudflare for domain registrations! if it takes them days to attend urgent issues, and you cannot chat or speak to their registrar department!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
