It is like my brain. Once it starts to think about long term goals and strategies, it can’t switch to doing simple tasks and tactics.<p>So every day, I wake up and revise my goals and strategies and get them out of the way. Once my brain is reassured that I am on the right track, I try to forget them altogether. Just try shaking it off with the promise of returning to it in the evening. Till then, no re-strategizing, no making sure we are on the right track. I am not even going to remember them.<p>It might be pronounced by some of you and is probably weird that I need to do it to myself, but hey, that’s how my brain is designed, and it’s a big deal for me now that I have discovered this works for me.<p>The author is the founder of Proxies API (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.proxiesapi.com&#x2F;), a proxy rotation api service.<p>This article originally appeared here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.proxiesapi.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;Remember-To-Forget-About-Your-Long-Term-Goals-Every-Day.php",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The power is infinite. It is called &quot;Prompts matrix&quot;.<p>You can run it from your own computer preferably with 8GB VRAM+ GPU, or cloud-based virtual machine (I managed to run it on Microsoft Azure but not for cheap).

Check out the link &quot;Portable Windows&quot;. You can commandline it and batch a whole folder with a .bat script, on Windows (and Unix of course). It&#x27;s free, no strings attached (as far as I know).<p>If you generate texture or paintings you can generate a normal map and a displacement map, with CrazyBump.com. You can BATCH it a whole folder to their respective normals. There is a free trial which does the job, but buy it if you can, because it&#x27;s awesome.<p>Here is a cool link about SD: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lexica.art&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lexica.art&#x2F;</a> (&quot;the SD search engine&quot;)
