32920926,Just stop it A rant about entitlement in tech (not what you think),2022-09-21T04:54:26Z,robomartin,2,false,false,2,[32921018],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I have grown really sick of two things, which often go together:<p><pre><code>  - Devices that require (and only offer) control via an app on a phone
  - Devices that require you to create an account on a website
    and log-in to be able to control them
  - A combination of the above, sometimes even combined with a desktop app
</code></pre>
I won&#x27;t go into all the reasons for detesting this other than to point out that there must be a degree of entitlement in device manufacturers.  When I buy your faucet, water pressure monitor or 3D printer, I have no interest whatsoever in having my data go through your network in any way.  You are not entitled to it just because you sold me a faucet.  Or whatever.<p>This rant was inspired by this new 3D printer I received today.  The Bambu Lab X1 Carbon.  All indications are that I cannot run this thing without creating an account with the manufacturer and logging in to both the printer and the desktop application (and maybe even the phone app).<p>I have over 20 printers, a good deal of them custom built.  Not one of them requires anything even remotely close to this.  They can all be accessed and managed over the network without having to have an account on anyone&#x27;s server and having data go outside our network.  Our clients don&#x27;t want anything to do with the potential for their data leaving our network.  In some cases we are legally required to make sure it does not (ITAR).<p>At home, we have a whole-house water monitor that checks pressure, flow and does a few more things.  It&#x27;s a valve with some sensors.  And the manufacturer (Moen) wants to reach into my home and have access to my entire network as well as the data captured by this device.<p>Why are manufacturers entitled like this?  My guess is that consumers have no awareness at all when it comes to security and privacy and don&#x27;t push back.  If you can intrude into someone&#x27;s life, grab their data and sell it, with their consent --because all of these gizmos have EULA&#x27;s nobody reads, well, why not?  Right?<p>And then there&#x27;s the question of obsolescence.  My HP-41 calculator runs just fine, decades later.  It does not depend on a server being up and running somewhere, or another consumer device being available at all.  Imagine not being able to use your 3D printer or faucet in 10 or 20 years because the iPhone app is broken or the server it needs to talk to is gone.  How is that good for consumers, at all?<p>I hate over-regulation on the part of government.  This, however, might just be a good case for it.  A faucet or a water valve should not require a connection to a server and a spying account to function.  Neither does a toilet, a 3D printer or a camera.<p>I did say it was a rant...",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
