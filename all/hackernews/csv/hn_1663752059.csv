Now we see that most &quot;front end&quot; devs don&#x27;t even write plain JavaScript, first it was TypeScript - a back-end language imo, and now we are seeing WASM as perhaps another nail in the coffin.<p>I remember reading an article on HN, proposing a &quot;front of the front end&quot; developer [0], which I think is pretty much symptomatic of the convoluted situation.<p>Before when i used to apply for jobs, i would get some kind of html&#x2F;css test. Now when i apply i get a hacker-rank test to deal with some algorithms, and i have to choose from js,ts,python,c++ etc. I think it says it all.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bradfrost.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;front-of-the-front-end-and-back-of-the-front-end-web-development&#x2F;",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Hurl is a command line tool powered by curl, that runs HTTP requests defined in a simple plain text format:<p><pre><code>  # Get home:
  GET https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.org
  
  HTTP&#x2F;1.1 200
  [Captures]
  csrf_token: xpath &quot;string(&#x2F;&#x2F;meta[@name=&#x27;_csrf_token&#x27;]&#x2F;@content)&quot;

  # Do login!
  POST https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.org&#x2F;login?user=toto&amp;password=1234
  X-CSRF-TOKEN: 

  HTTP&#x2F;1.1 302

</code></pre>
Hurl can be used to get data like curl, or as an integration testing tool for JSON&#x2F;XML HTTP apis &#x2F; HTML content. Requests can be chained, and one can add asserts on response headers, cookies and body.<p>For instance:<p><pre><code>  GET https:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.org&#x2F;order
  screencapability: low

  HTTP&#x2F;1.1 200
  [Asserts]
  jsonpath &quot;$.validated&quot; == true
  jsonpath &quot;$.userInfo.lastName&quot; == &quot;Herbert&quot;
  jsonpath &quot;$.hasDevice&quot; == false
  jsonpath &quot;$.links&quot; count == 12
  jsonpath &quot;$.order&quot; matches &#x2F;^order-\d{8}$&#x2F;
</code></pre>
You can see more samples in the documentation [2].<p>We&#x27;ve designed Hurl to be easily integrated in CI&#x2F;CD (GitHub, GitLab), and its text format can be used as a documentation, commited in a repo etc... It&#x27;s a single binary written in Rust, that is powered by libcurl under the hood, for a fast CLI tool for both devops and developers.<p>In this new version, we&#x27;ve added the following improvements:<p>- verbose output: add more color to Hurl --verbose output, and also added --very-verbose option to output request and response bodies<p>- request options: command-line options such as --location (follow HTTP redirection), --verbose, --insecure etc... can now be applied to a particular request with an [Options] sections<p>- and more, see here for a quick tout of 1.7.0 [3]<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Orange-OpenSource&#x2F;hurl"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Orange-OpenSource&#x2F;hurl</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hurl.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;samples.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hurl.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;samples.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hurl.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;announcing-hurl-1.7.0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hurl.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2022&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;announcing-hurl-1.7.0.html</a><p>Previous Show HN &lt;<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28758226"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=28758226</a>&gt; and &lt;<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25655737"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25655737</a>&gt;",story,https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hurl,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
