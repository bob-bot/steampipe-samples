Binocs [1] is an Uptime Monitoring tool for people who spend their workdays on the command line and are obsessed with accuracy and reliability.<p>When I started using the existing uptime monitoring solutions for the services my team and I were responsible for, I thought the world didn&#x27;t need another such tool. Then I changed my opinion, as I became disappointed by the reliability and general quality of the existing tools. I tried to make an uptime monitoring tool that is reliable and fits the modern dev&#x2F;ops toolkit.<p>Binocs provides the standard features you might expect from an uptime monitoring tool, plus a modern command-line interface [2] and a Terraform provider [3]. Binocs gives makers of the internet 24&#x2F;7 insight into the availability of the services they care for and notifies them - via the usual communication channels such as SMS, Telegram, or Slack - if any of these services become, for whatever reason, unavailable. Binocs monitors uptime, apdex, and response time (broken down to its basic components) from any custom set of geolocations the user selects for each check.<p>There are binaries available for major platforms and architectures [4].<p>Binocs is written in Golang and relies on TimescaleDB for storing and aggregating time-series data. The solution is highly redundant and hosted on AWS (hybrid deployment is on the roadmap). The algorithm meticulously strives to eliminate both false positives and false negatives.<p>If you want to try Binocs, only an e-mail address is required to sign-up. We use passwordless authentication. Every new account gets 250k free credits [5].<p>You can also watch a short video demo [6].<p>Any feedback is much appreciated, and I&#x27;m, of course, open to technical questions as well.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binocs.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binocs.sh</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binocs.sh&#x2F;documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binocs.sh&#x2F;documentation</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;registry.terraform.io&#x2F;providers&#x2F;automato-io&#x2F;binocs&#x2F;latest"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;registry.terraform.io&#x2F;providers&#x2F;automato-io&#x2F;binocs&#x2F;l...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binocs.sh&#x2F;downloads"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binocs.sh&#x2F;downloads</a><p>[5] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binocs.sh&#x2F;pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;binocs.sh&#x2F;pricing</a><p>[6] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TsHvTbsFWtg"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TsHvTbsFWtg</a>",story,https://binocs.sh,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
