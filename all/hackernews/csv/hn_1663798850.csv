It&#x27;s great because there&#x27;s lots of flexibility and not much micromanagement.<p>It&#x27;s challenging because:<p>- I often need to learn and evaluate new products (e.g some SaaS we might want to use). On a related note it&#x27;s often difficult to get good (sometimes any) support for products we&#x27;re paying for, so I waste time debugging obscure issues or reading through confusing documentation<p>- I don&#x27;t really have anyone to delegate to. I could coordinate with managers to negotiate for engineers&#x27; time, but this would take almost as long as just doing some of the tasks myself, so I don&#x27;t do this<p>- Verification is difficult. Infrastructure doesn&#x27;t have as good testing facilities as &quot;regular&quot; software does, and even when it does that still takes some setup, which must be balanced against everything else I&#x27;m supposed to be doing and the new things that come up.<p>- I often am asking for review for people not on my (mostly solo) team, which can take time and extra reminders<p>- I mostly get requests from everywhere, manage my own backlog, and people are busy enough that they really only see what they need to remind me to do (because there&#x27;s a lot to do), rather than all the little things I get done<p>This is better than previous similar roles I&#x27;ve had, as the teams are nicer and I don&#x27;t own everything I touch, but I feel I&#x27;m falling behind and will not get recognition unless I &quot;sell&quot; my accomplishments (which of course I don&#x27;t have time to do anyway).<p>I don&#x27;t really feel I can turn work down, and don&#x27;t really care to, but I&#x27;m finding it difficult to get it all done and still work a regular amount of hours.<p>It&#x27;s also difficult to ask for help, as in the past when I&#x27;ve asked for training I&#x27;ve been told things like &quot;ohh that&#x27;s not too hard&quot;, which is generally true for most products once you&#x27;ve got the hang of them, but never getting training on anything is a recipe for lots of half-baked solutions, or lots of time off the clock reading and experimenting.<p>I worry trying to define my role will lead to micromanagement. I worry not doing so will lead to burnout or me missing things. I worry discussing these issues with management or fellow engineers will make me look incompetent or unwilling to do my job. I also worry it&#x27;s going to get increasingly difficult to advance in this role, as the more I do the more I&#x27;ll be asked to look into, and with things being difficult to test&#x2F;verify, the small tasks will continue to pile up as I try to work on the large tasks.<p>How have you handled this situation in the past, other DevOps&#x2F;IT folks?<p>I added in IT because I&#x27;m also given administrative tasks as needed (migrating some accounts&#x2F;debugging issues that aren&#x27;t strictly software related).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
