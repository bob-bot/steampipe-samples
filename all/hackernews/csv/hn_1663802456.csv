So, we will likely see ever more ads across all media platforms.<p>The TradeDesk [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thetradedesk.com] projects that the global digital advertising market will be worth $1 Trillion dollars in the near future and that TV&#x2F;Cable TV will be approx. 50% of that total. The same company states that “programmatic advertising” today represents 16-million Internet ads per second!<p>How&#x2F;why is this market growing so fast? Are seller response rates increasing or decreasing? Why are sellers spending so much money to reach buyers?  The answer must be that it’s working, otherwise the market would be shrinking in size. There must be millions of people globally that are clicking on these ads for this marketplace to work. So it seems, not everyone is unhappy with the system as it works today.<p>For the rest of us, how would a better digital ad system work?<p>- How to architect relevant advertising and still respect user privacy?<p>- What is a cost-effective way for sellers to reach buyers?<p>- Does advertising still work if user tracking is blocked?<p>- Is it possible to create an opt-in system for buyers?<p>- Should buyers be compensated to look at ads?<p>- Should buyers be compensated for their data?<p>If you were going to build a new system from scratch, what would it look like?<p>Thx.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
