After a recent trip to 6 cities across the USA It became apparent to me that what many of our cities lack is good bike infrastructure and a car centric mentality. I see better bike infrastructure as a huge solution to many problems (assuming people adopt riding bikes as a &quot;new&quot; mode of transport). I would personally love to get rid of at least one of my two family cars if there where good bike infrastructure in my city.<p>So all that to preface my question... what are some actionable ways I can influence my city to build more bike friendly roads and infrastructure? Also how much of road design is designed by state&#x2F;federal influences and how much control does a city have on the way roads are designed?,story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
