I&#x27;m writing here as I am desperate to remove the suspension on my Facebook account and Instagram account. I work with my Instagram account and I am currently loosing money on collaborations and sponsorships.<p>On Sunday 18th September my personal Facebook page was hacked and the hacker started posting content that goes against the Facebook guidelines. I have proof showing that it was not me as the location of the hacker was Indiana, US while I live in Malta, EU. Unfortunately at that time I did not realise that. The hacker managed to log-in and posted content that went against the Facebook regulations resulting to Facebook blocking my personal account and also my Instagram account which is linked to it.<p>I have been trying to fill form and also fill a form to disagree with the Facebook decision but when I try to log-in to Facebook all I get is a notification that my Facebook is suspended. I keep going round in circles and all support is suggesting is to fill forms that I can not fill with my suspended account.<p>Can anyone help, maybe anyone that works at Facebook or can get me in touch with someone. I am willing to pay for professional help.<p>Thanks
