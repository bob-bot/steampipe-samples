Tap the Plus button on the far bottom right<p>2. Select the Rectangle or Circle shape<p>3.

Position solid shape over the sensitive information<p>...<p>My argument is that while it is possible to properly redact sensitive information, it&#x27;s much too easy for people to improperly redact because it is difficult to tell that a 100% opacity black highlighter does not work. On a phone screen, it can look completely opaque. Only once you see it on a better display do you realize just how visible the info is.<p>Also, while the pencil&#x2F;pen tool (far left) does properly redact, its max size is much too small. People who use this one and just haphazardly try to scribble over all of the info, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn&#x27;t.<p>Solutions:<p>1. Create a tool specific for redacting<p>2. Make it so that 100% opacity highlighting is opaque (or at least warn the user if they set the opacity to 100%). Yes, this is not what &quot;highlighting&quot; is, but make the default opacity value like 30-50% and have people change it as needed. If it looks opaque on a phone screen, IT SHOULD BE.<p>3.
