I use iTunes for my local files, then Spotify has its own library of &quot;liked&quot; files, YouTube has its own playlists, SoundCloud has its own, and so on.<p>I would love for there to be some kind of simple app that lets me build a music library that incorporates all of these sources. I&#x27;m envisioning something kind of iTunes or Winamp-esque, except instead of the elements having to be files, they&#x27;d instead just be tokens that could point to a local file, or a remote HTTP URL, or a spotify: URI or a YouTube video or whatever. I would be able to put some kind of basic metadata on each one and organize things into artists, albums, and so on, as well as make playlists.<p>Does something exist that can do this?
