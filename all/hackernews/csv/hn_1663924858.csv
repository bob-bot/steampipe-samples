Plus they usually didn&#x27;t have all the features I wanted (for example some of them only had inpainting and some only had img2img, so if I wanted both I had to repeatedly copy images between notebooks). So I made this desktop frontend which has much smoother performance than notebook alternatives and integrates image generation, inpainting and img2img into the same workflow. See a video demo here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;6392321&#x2F;191858568-0550f52d-e89c-4b37-aa07-23df605b4807.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;user-images.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;6392321&#x2F;191858568-...</a><p>Features include:<p>* Can run locally or connect to a google colab server<p>* Ability to erase<p>* Ability to paint custom colors into the image. It is useful both for img2img (you can sketch a rough prototype and reimagine it into something nice) and inpainting (for example, you can paint a pixel red and it forces Stable Diffusion to put something red in there)<p>* Infinite undo&#x2F;redo<p>* You can import your other images into a scratch pad and paste them into main image after erasing&#x2F;cropping&#x2F;scaling it<p>* Increase image size (by padding with transparent empty margins) for outpainting",story,https://github.com/ahrm/UnstableFusion,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
