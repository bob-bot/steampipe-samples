    Hey xxxx, 

    I saw on Github that you are interested in tilt.dev.  I hope you don&#x27;t mind me reaching out to you personally. 

    While we really love tilt.dev, we always had a few issues with it. For example Tilt does not create a cluster for you, so there is at least one more tool our devs have to deal with. 

    In addition Starlark, the Tiltfile definition language, is too complex for our taste and the recent acquisition of Tilt by Docker made us kind of unsure about the future of the tool. 

    Anyway, we came up with a new open source project called Getdeck that creates reproducible Kubernetes environments for development and testing. It’s a command-line application and file specification around the concept of a Kubernetes Deck. 

    I&#x27;d really appreciate if you had a look https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getdeck.dev&#x2F; 

    I&#x27;d really love to hear your feedback on this and maybe some input on if you feel there is something missing with regards to features, documentation or usecases? 

    Kind regards 

    Michael Schilonka
