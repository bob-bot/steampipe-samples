32951082,Show HN: Morgan – PyPI Mirror for Restricted/Offline Environments,2022-09-23T12:39:04Z,idop,11,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Mirroring PyPI packages for environments&#x2F;networks that do not have access to the Internet is hard. It&#x27;s actually hard even in environments that do have access to the Internet. Most solutions out there either:<p>1. Depend on pip to download and cache package distributions. This means those downloads will probably only work in a similar environment (same Python interpreter, same libc), because of the nature of binary package distributions and the fact that packages have optional dependencies for different environments.<p>2. Depend on other PyPI packages, meaning installing the mirror in a restricted environment in itself is too difficult.<p>3. Cannot resolve dependencies of dependencies, meaning mirroring PyPI partially is extremely difficult, and PyPI is huge.<p>Morgan works differently. It creates a mirror based on a configuration file that defines target environments (using Python&#x27;s standard Environment Markers specification from PEP 345) and a list of package requirement strings (e.g. &quot;requests&gt;=2.24.0&quot;). It downloads all files relevant to the target environments from PyPI (both source and binary distributions), and recursively resolves and downloads their dependencies, again based on the target environments. It then extracts a single-file server to the mirror directory that works with Python 3.7+, has no outside dependencies, and implements the standard Simple API. This directory can be copied to the restricted network, through whatever security policies are in place, and deployed easily with a simple `python server.py` command.<p>I should note that Morgan can find dependencies from various metadata sources inside package distributions, including standard METADATA&#x2F;PKG-INFO&#x2F;pyproject.toml files, and non-standard files such as setuptools&#x27; requires.txt.<p>There&#x27;s more information in the Git repository. If this is interesting to you, I&#x27;ll be happy to receive your feedback.<p>Thanks!",story,https://github.com/ido50/morgan,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32951509,Ask HN: Innovations from crypto that have nothing to do with blockchains/tokens?,2022-09-23T13:18:01Z,brntsllvn,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"&quot;To the moon&quot; might be apt. In 1969 the U.S. sent humans to the moon for bragging rights. We ended up learning a lot.<p>Setting aside the value of the blockchain database and the utility or speculative potential of individual coins and tokens... What real world innovation is emerging as a byproduct of crypto?<p>Some examples:
- The Merge taught us decentralized dev teams could heft a major refactor with zero downtime. Impressive.
- Automated liquidations reveal how backward and manual traditional prime brokers mitigate margin risk (i.e. they wait too long to call margin and then explode). Ignore 3AC case. Their lenders were ironically manual.
- Investors don&#x27;t read or don&#x27;t understand terms of service and are suseptible to financial predation (see web3 is going great) and the protections of the banking system, however antiquated, are actually pretty nice (eg FDIC insurance vs Celsius &quot;savings&quot; account)
- Risk eventually emerges. Whether way out of the money options, crappy MBS, or coins&#x2F;tokens, they end up trading like risk assets. When people get scared, they sell. When people need to free up capital, they sell. Suddenly everything is correlated.<p>What other innovations or critical problems are emerging from this vast experience?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
