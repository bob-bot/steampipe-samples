I&#x27;d rather like to comment on the DX.<p>I&#x27;m a long-time lurker here on HN and in 2019 I felt the urge to develop my own take on a media center application.<p>Media Hoarder was already usable after a few days of development and after one year it had 90% of the features I wished for myself but was not exactly ready for a release to the public. So, for this project the last 10% took another two years :)<p>During the development I read a lot about the &quot;ship fast&quot; mindset which I obviously did not adopt. I could never live with a publicly released version that does not completely show what I had in mind with the app. And yeah, currently my focus is not to get external feedback as fast as possible but to create and release a product as v1.0.0 that I envisioned and use myself.<p>The tech-stack is:<p>- Electron
- Vue.js with Vuetify
- SQLite<p>this way the app runs on Win&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;Mac and can be entirely developed with web technologies - which to me is a great plus regarding development speed. Mind you, Media Hoarder is developed during the free-time of a father of two young kids :D<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m really glad it&#x27;s out there. Personally, I use it every day and I hope, some of you may find it useful or would like to contribute.<p>Please feel free to discuss features, development and sideproject-y things, I&#x27;m really curious :)<p>Media Hoarder Website: &lt;<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.hoarder.software"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.hoarder.software</a>&gt;
