32969294,Avatar IMAX 3D re-release: subtitles are messed up,2022-09-25T06:00:43Z,vivegi,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"The highly expected James Cameron sequel to the very successful film Avatar (2009) is releasing later this year. The 2009 version was re-released in IMAX 3D version recently (here in India), presumably to capitalize on the hype for the sequel and to re-introduce the film to new audiences. It ran to packed houses. I had watched the film in 2009 but not in 3D. So, I watched the IMAX 3D version this week. The film is great in IMAX 3D. However, I had a couple of issues.<p>The film released with English subtitles (quite common in India) and whoever did the postproduction&#x2F;processing for the subtitles screwed up.<p>1. The subtitles were placed almost 1&#x2F;3rd from the bottom (presumably because they were lazy with doing one pass for both IMAX 3D and regular 3D versions). This was annoying.<p>2. The subtitles also moved around a lot. Part of it, I guess, was due to the 3D perspective and the subtitle text seemed to jump forward and backward on the z-axis. This was more than annoying, it was disorienting.<p>The part that sucked was the film had English translations for the Na&#x27;vi dialogues (burned into the frame with the Avatar typeface). They were perfect and did not have the distortions on the overlaid English subtitles. So, I am wondering why the postproduction&#x2F;subtitling team couldn&#x27;t have gone the extra effort to ensure a better quality output.<p>If any industry folks are reading this, please please please, take care of this in your films. Thank you!<p>ps: I don&#x27;t have a problem with subtitles per se although I prefer films without them. The issue I have is with not taking into account the interplay of subtitle placement in a 3D frame.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
