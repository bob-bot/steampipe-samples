I often use the &quot;Search&quot; feature to surface articles I am interested about, and many times I happen upon posts in the 100+ votes from the past day or two that somehow I didn&#x27;t even see.<p>I wonder if the really quick decaying algorithm paired with the amount of quality posts creates the unfortunate situation that reaching the front page or the intended audience is just a matter of pure luck.

32970485,Ask HN: Why aren't modern mobile apps design to fail stable?,2022-09-25T11:44:19Z,harshaw,2,false,false,2,"[32970658,32970490]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"I haven&#x27;t built mobile apps in years.  These days I carry an Android phone and am generally unhappy with how poorly these applications require a network connection to do anything. Many apps don&#x27;t fail stable in the sense that if there is a server error they don&#x27;t present the last known good view of data.  What this means in practice is if there is low network availability (on a train, at a concert or festival, a sporting event) many of these apps completely break.<p>Back years ago I would design apps to sync to a local database (which was relatively easy to do on IOS). Apps would maintain consistent state on the device and leverage local storage.  I haven&#x27;t looked under the hood but many apps appear to be using HTMLish front ends that are stateless, except for some cached login information.  As a user - what I see is that the app repeatedly tries to login and fetch all information <i>every time</i> you load it.  Which if you have perfect LTE&#x2F;5G&#x2F;WIFI is sort of ok, but in other situations sucks.  if the app can&#x27;t talk to the network it really doesn&#x27;t work at all.<p>Example apps that generally fail stable: gmail, text messaging
Sort of fail stable: slack, although if you get a push message slack requires talking to the network to get the message <i>even</i> though it came through the push message.  In practice this means significant latency between seeing the message on the phone and then going to the conversation view (which can take forever to load under poor networking).  Back when I built apps we stuck the contents of the push message in the local DB so it was visible for users
