32973268,I need your help on a business idea,2022-09-25T16:54:29Z,claudio_h,2,false,false,1,[32973450],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello guys,
I hope you had a lovely day so far.<p>Now why am I posting this? Because I need your help.
Let me explain my problem. At the moment I am working on a project which tries to connect people through food. The idea is that if you like to cook and meet new people you can invite them to your place. I would be the middleman like air bnb and connect the cooks with the guests. 
First of all. It’s nothing new. The main idea exists already but what do you think about the concept? Secondly, how do you think the cooks can be motivated to want to cook on the platform? Because in Switzerland you are quickly classified as a restaurant, hence making it not possible to make any profit of the dinner if you don’t meet restaurant standards.
Now do you think that getting to know new people is enough? A benefit could be a discount with partners, for example on cooking classes. Another option could be a 5-10CHF Coupon from time to time for having successful dinners. Another one is to be part of a Cooking Community which shares different recipes and inspires. Basically, establishing a network with the other cooks. I of course could combine those incentives but somehow I am still not convinced, which is why I am writing this post. I am also open to different business models! Feel free to share whatever came to your mind.
I want to thank you in advance for your feedback!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
