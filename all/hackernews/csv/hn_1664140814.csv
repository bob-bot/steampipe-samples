I enjoy giving it, and I&#x27;d like to make it a monthly&#x2F;weekly or whatever side gig with pay. How would you pitch this in an e-mail or call, and what would you think reasonable pricing is for this?<p>First, some context:<p>Through an investor in the company I am engineering manager of, I got asked to give some advice to another company they invested in. They were having some issues in their development team, and a non-technical founder had to take over management temporarily and was genuinely motivated to do an excellent job of it and make the development team feel happy and productive.<p>We had an excellent talk, and I was able to give some clarity to some concerns and provide him with some good insights.<p>The other day I received an e-mail from them again, thanking me for the advice. They said it really helped a lot, and they already saw results. And they had a different question related to some payment things and asked if I wanted to talk to their CFO. They also said they wanted to respect my time, which was evident from our first talk.<p>Coming back to my question:<p>As I said, I enjoy it; I can spend an hour here or there per month or some other interval which I think would provide them with some good value in exchange for a fee, and I could learn from it myself as well. How would you pitch this idea?<p>I got this idea from listening to an episode of Art of Product with Rob Walling, in which he explains he does this consulting once a week for an hour with several companies. I am no Rob Walling, but I can share some good advice every now and then.<p>Are there any people here with experience with these types of consultancy arrangements? Any advice on pricing? Any ideas on the pitch?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
