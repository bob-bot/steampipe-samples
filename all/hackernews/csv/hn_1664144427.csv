32976728,Tell HN: My Hacker News app (HACK) is sort of broken this afternoon,2022-09-25T21:53:12Z,busymom0,4,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I am the developer for HACK, a hacker news app on iOS, iPadOS, MacOS and Android. It&#x27;s one of the top HN apps on the App Store.<p>As of this afternoon, I received lots of emails reporting a bug in the app where:<p>1. Tapping on a story was taking to the link for the story instead of the comments. There was no way to access the comments.<p>2. All stories showed &quot;now&quot; as the time posted instead of the correct time.<p>3. Threads didn&#x27;t display the title for the parent post.<p>This occurred due to Hacker News making some changes to its website&#x27;s HTML today.<p>Since the Hacker News API is pretty much useless (it&#x27;s a read only API and doesn&#x27;t allow voting, favoriting, commenting etc. Also very hard to work with), my app relies on the website which it parses to get the content. It does the parsing using XPath. Due to the changes in the HTML, the XPath in the app were no longer valid.<p>I have already submitted an update to Apple and the Play Store for fixing this bug. Hoping to have it approved soon (hopefully sometime tonight&#x2F;tomorrow).<p>I am really sorry about the inconvenience to all the users who rely on my app.<p>The apps are:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;ca&#x2F;app&#x2F;hack-for-hacker-news-reader&#x2F;id1464477788<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.pranapps.hack<p>Feel free to ask questions.

My savings are running out but I still don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ll be able to work full time without it detrimentally affecting my mental health.
I was thinking about doing some tutoring and did some of that for my friends studying IT, and for my mental health it seems optimal, as I like doing it and don&#x27;t feel mental strain associated with doing my job. I also wrote a Linux tutorial long ago and was thinking about doing more of this as it turns out that I really like to teach, but life and full time job interfered with those plans. For those interested my tutorial is saved here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;xDb8o<p>Please tell me if you know how I can earn some money doing Linux tutoring and maybe mentoring, maybe through some companies or communities interested in that. I have a decade of experience working with Linux, FreeBSD, computers networks, and so on and so forth up to modern things and practices like Chaos Engineering, AWS, CI&#x2F;CD, Ansible and so on.<p>Also I might be able to do some part-time jobs with load of several hours per day, if you know where I should seek for those I&#x27;d be grateful too.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
