Of course my page was taken down and I was banned.<p>Now, no human to talk to.  I have lodged a Police Report, seems they cant even get access to the page and the video content.  Why are Facebook not lodging a police report?  They are trafficking child pornography not me!!<p>I&#x27;m a 63 year old grandma.  I could open a new account with fake ID but then how can I get my deceased parents to add me as a friend?  How can I see the trips and travels I have made around the world again?  And many friends I have are only Facebook and Messenger friends and that&#x27;s how we chose to keep in contact without thinking the this can be taken away in an instant.<p>There&#x27;s a button to download data but it doesn&#x27;t download anything because its around 15 years to posts and pics!!<p>Punish the Hacker Facebook, not the victim!!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
