So for the following HTML document:<p><pre><code>    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;main&gt;Hello World&lt;&#x2F;main&gt;
        &lt;&#x2F;body&gt;
    &lt;&#x2F;html&gt;
</code></pre>
I expect the document object to <i>kind</i> of look like:<p><pre><code>    html (element): {
        \n\t (text),
        body (element): {
            \n\t (text),
            main (element): {Hello World (text)},
            \n (text)
        },
        \n (text)
    }
</code></pre>
But what I get is more like a mix of nodes, properties, methods and prototypes:<p><pre><code>    URL: ..., &lt;-- a property
    activeElement: ..., &lt;-- a property
    body: ..., &lt;-- an element
    childElementCount: 1, &lt;-- a property
    head: ..., &lt;-- an element
    main: ..., &lt;-- an element
    onclick: ..., &lt;-- a method
    &lt;prototype&gt;: ..., &lt;-- a bunch of prototypes
    ...
</code></pre>
Is the DOM actually a tree of objects representing the items in an HTML document PLUS extra data (properties) and the means to manipulate it (methods) or is it just an abstraction (after all it has model in its name) that differs from its implementation (document object)?<p>*what you get when typing <i>document</i> in the browser console or when calling it from Javascript",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

They could for example automate the aspects of their job that are mundane and stretch their grant money further.<p>I also see many entrepreneurs come up with companies that combine programming with their primary area of expertise.
