32984992,Show HN: Airplane Views – code-first platform for building internal UIs,2022-09-26T16:18:25Z,joshma,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN, I&#x27;m Josh, one of the founders of Airplane! Airplane Views is our take on building internal tool UIs and is the newest component of our platform (alongside Tasks and Workflows).<p>With Views, you can build admin dashboards, product usage charts, moderation inboxes, and more with just a few React components on a page. Views pair well with Tasks (our Lambda-like functions service)—you can write Tasks to fetch a list of customers or suspend a user, and hook them up to e.g. a Table or Button:<p><pre><code>  import { Button, Stack, Table } from &quot;airplane&quot;;
  
  const AdminPanel = () =&gt; (
    &lt;Stack&gt;
      &lt;Table task=&quot;list_new_teams&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
      &lt;Button task=&quot;suspend_user&quot;&gt;Suspend&lt;&#x2F;Button&gt;
    &lt;&#x2F;Stack&gt;
  );
</code></pre>
Internal tools tend to be under-invested yet power core parts of businesses. We want to help tools reach the same level of rigor as production software, and we believe using code is the right approach. Need to re-use some logic? Import it. Need a custom component? Build it yourself. Need to migrate off Airplane to your own system? We hope you don&#x27;t, but you can refactor and reuse your existing code.<p>We think there are great low-code&#x2F;no-code tools out there for building internal tools, but from our experience there have been few truly focused on developers. A lot of tools support e.g. writing JavaScript within a product, but we think being dev-focused goes beyond that:<p>- The core authoring flow should revolve around code. Views in Airplane are written in TS&#x2F;JS, and Tasks support TS&#x2F;JS, Python, Docker image, and shell scripts. You run airplane deploy from a CLI to, well, deploy it to Airplane.<p>- The tool should fit developer workflows. Develop locally, write tests, open a PR, push to deploy,  promote to prod, etc. Someone shouldn&#x27;t be able to break tools for the support team with a SQL typo.<p>- Plus, you can see how others have built things, remix examples, and share it back: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;airplanedev&#x2F;templates"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;airplanedev&#x2F;templates</a><p>The challenge is making this easy to learn and use. We think Views will work because the surface area for internal tools is smaller. We can be more opinionated, and a design system is built-in. You can use Layout, Table, Form, and Chart and get 90% of the way there. We&#x27;ve put a lot of effort into our docs (docs.airplane.dev), although we still have ways to go.  And we&#x27;re working on making building easier: you&#x27;ll soon be able to edit Views in your browser, and things like drag-and-drop builders can be later layered on top.<p>Views has been in private beta for a few weeks, during which 20+ teams have built and deployed 50+ views in production. We&#x27;ve had several developers new to React tell us it was simple to create Views in Airplane. We&#x27;d love for you to give it a go and send us your feedback!",story,https://www.airplane.dev,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Modern ICE cars easily hit 300,000 KM with routine maintenance and maybe one or two repairs.  What about EVs?  It seems that as long as you replace the battery every ??? KM, it should last indefinitely.  But in reality, that is not going to be the case.  What will the limitation be?  My guess is electronics&#x2F;software failure.

32984776,Ask HN: What's the best “higher level Rust” these days?,2022-09-26T15:58:45Z,losvedir,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"After playing with rust, I really like it. However, I generally don&#x27;t need to write the low level code that justifies the increased complexity of the borrow checker. I would rather just pay the small price for a garbage collector. What language is most like rust, but at a higher level?<p>To me, these are the things that I like about rust that I&#x27;d want to see:<p>* Getting nullability right, not making the &quot;billion dollar mistake&quot;. An integer shouldn&#x27;t be able to be &quot;null&quot; unless it&#x27;s part of the type.<p>* &quot;Algebraic&quot; (Sum and Product) data types. I love Typescript&#x27;s &quot;integer | null&quot; syntax, but Option&lt;int&gt; or something like that is fine, too. Typed structs&#x2F;records or tuples.<p>* Errors as values. Goes naturally with the ADTs, and it feels very robust having the compiler enforce handling all the &quot;Ok(..) | Err(..)&quot; results.<p>* Focus on the data, defining structs and functions that work with structs. &quot;Traits&quot; as a means of abstraction. Not much in the way of inheritance.<p>* A nice development experience with a good package manager or other way of finding and using open source code.<p>* Vibrant and growing community.<p>* Can develop comfortably on Mac, deploy to Linux. Windows support a &quot;nice to have&quot;.<p>Rust just nails all these things so well, it makes me want to use it even for things that don&#x27;t seem like a good fit to me, like command line tools or web servers or scripts.<p>Here are the languages I can think of that might work, but I think they all have some issues:<p>* Ocaml - Rust&#x27;s heritage, so it makes sense. But I feel like it&#x27;s been around forever and hasn&#x27;t really taken off. And doesn&#x27;t it still have some sort of concurrency issue?<p>* Swift - So close to the ideal language, but does it work well outside of the Mac ecosystem?<p>* F# - Conversely, another great language, but does it work well outside of Windows?<p>* Java - The last time I used Java in earnest (many, many years ago) it still had the nullability issue, and was too class&#x2F;inheritance focused for my tastes. I&#x27;m not sure if modern Java has improved on this yet.<p>* Typescript - Is this it? As a language, it actually ticks all the boxes, I think, which surprises me. But as a runtime it&#x27;s nonexistent, and so you have to compile to Javascript and run on node and all that. I use it and really like it on the frontend. But how is it on the backend for ordinary non-web applications? How&#x27;s its performance? It feels fiddly to get all the build stuff running, but maybe Deno or Bun is an option here.<p>* Nim - Kind of off the wall here, but it looks like it might actually be a contender from perusing its docs. But its community is pretty niche, and I don&#x27;t have a good sense on if its growing or not.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Physical based skills need maintenance or else those will get rusty.<p>To give an analogy about the difference:<p>- Music theory -&gt; Knowledge based<p>- Playing guitar -&gt; Physical based<p>I myself have multiple physical skills that I maintain over the years (I am 35):<p>- Guitar<p>- Vocal<p>- Karate<p>- Calisthenics<p>- Programming<p>- Botany<p>As I get older and have more responsibilities (families, kids, jobs, communities), and as these skills get more and more advanced, how do I realistically maintain all of these?<p>For example, in the matter of guitar alone, there are different genres, different types of picking. In the matter of programming, there are different programming languages.<p>My approach in learning various knowledge based skills is just one, reading, read a lot, reflect a lot, and that seems to suffice to make it go into long term memory (at least the ability to roughly recall). But I don&#x27;t know how to do it with various physical based skills other than just keep doing it over and over to maintain it.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
