Some people may like that, but it annoys the shit out of me, because I like to feel a sense of progression as I go down through the list over the course of the day. So this was borne out of my frustration really.<p>I also made it browser-based so it&#x27;s easy to access the same list on all devices without installing apps on all of them.<p>It&#x27;s free to use. It&#x27;s just something I made for myself and if others find it useful then that&#x27;s great.

fork (and thus also host their fork publicly).<p>The simplest version of what I want would be a &quot;Merge&#x2F;Pull Request&quot; workflow initiated by uploading a patch&#x2F;diff instead of creating a fork and requesting a merge from that fork.<p>One of the goals is accessibility: ideally anyone could click &quot;Edit&quot; on a file in the web UI to start a &quot;Patch Request.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve searched extensively for this and haven&#x27;t come up with much.
