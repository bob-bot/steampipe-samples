You might get a chat-like interface, but in the end, the conversation partner will only respond with a predefined &quot;if the users say X I say Y&quot;.<p>With Quazel that&#x27;s completely different. In completely dynamic and unscripted conversation you can talk about pretty much anything you want. For example, you can try ordering food at a restaurant and even hold a philosophical discussion with Socrates. Additionally, you can analyze the grammar of your responses or use hints to help you out when you get stuck.<p>We want to change how languages are learned from a grammar-centric approach to a more natural, conversation-focused one.",story,https://talk.quazel.com/chat/try,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
