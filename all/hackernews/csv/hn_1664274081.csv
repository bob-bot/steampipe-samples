32993368,Ask HN: Best practice for in-memory large data transformation,2022-09-27T09:55:37Z,sgignoux,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Does any of you have some recommendation on how to set up an in-memory data transformation system. I have been looking at DuckDB[1], but maybe there are interesting alternatives. Apache Arrow seems promising in some ways too.<p>It is about running a series of transformations, defined in SQL, on many tables, but:<p>- All the data can fit in the main memory of a single server (a few TB)<p>- No change in the data during processing (batch processing, all source files are Parquet files, all output files are Parquet files)<p>- Only one user at a time running the transformation (no need for transaction or isolation)<p>- No need for persistence during the computation of intermediate tables<p>From my understanding of how a database works, that should remove a lot of the bookkeeping that a standard database has to do in order to provide transactions and ACID properties. In return, one can expect an improvement in performance. I am looking at a kind of &quot;memory only database&quot;.<p>DuckDB looks like it should work, but I am not sure how mature it is.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckdb.org&#x2F;
