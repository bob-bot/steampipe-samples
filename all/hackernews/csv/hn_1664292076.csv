32995719,Ask HN: Choosing a framework for the next big thing,2022-09-27T14:32:46Z,ycomverdantnest,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Let&#x27;s pretend you&#x27;re working at a startup to build the next Airbnb. Your team is very small, it&#x27;s just you and maybe 1-2 other developers. You need to build an application with the following requirements&#x2F;assumptions:<p><pre><code>  - User facing &quot;CRUD&quot;
    - 10+ domain models (eg. House, Guest, Cart, Booking, etc)
    - Lots of forms w&#x2F; custom validation
    - Pagination so you can display 1k+ records in tables&#x2F;infinite-scroll
    - Some areas of rich interactivity (eg. Host availability calendar) but mostly presentational UI &#x2F; forms
  - Admin panel
  - Background jobs &#x2F; tasks
    - Scheduled - Run specific job at point in future (eg. Remind user in 3 months about upcoming trip)
    - Recurring - Run cron jobs for repetitive tasks (eg. Run daily report at midnight)
  - Emails &#x2F; Notifications
    - 10+ custom email templates (booking confirmation, upcoming trip reminder, etc.)
    - Usually sent via background job
  - File uploads &#x2F; storage (eg. Users upload pictures of house)
  - Auth
    - Users login to book
    - Hosts login to manage their home listings
  - Testing
    - Primarily integration &#x2F; e2e tests of core flows
</code></pre>
You need to choose a framework:<p><pre><code>  - Laravel (v9)
  - Rails (v7)
  - Django (v4)
  - Phoenix (v1.6)
</code></pre>
Which framework do you choose?<p>Assume your team knows each framework equally well. Which one allows you to start quickly and still be maintainable 2-3 years down the road while continually adding new features?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Not the same guy.<p>We&#x27;ve had a number of candidates in the pipeline who seemed to be obviously lying about their identities who didn&#x27;t make it to an offer but this case seemed different somehow. I cant quite put my finger on it.<p>I&#x27;m just curious to hear how many of you have experienced something similar. Is it common? Is there something obvious I&#x27;m not thinking of to help avoid these situations?<p>We may have passed on other candidates because of the strength of this one guy. This has put us in a pretty unfortunate position.<p>Some maybe noteworthy facts: we&#x27;re a 100% remote company. The candidate was US based and said they didn&#x27;t need visa sponsorship.
