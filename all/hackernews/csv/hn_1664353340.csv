  \* Git repo&#x27;s on gitlab

  \* Git repo&#x27;s on a self hosted gitlab

  \* Some small databases for custom applications i have made between 1 and 5 GB

  \* Some scattered data files on different servers.

  \* Some personal folder&#x2F;documents&#x2F;files on my laptop

  \* Some personal folder&#x2F;files document on my desktop

  \* Some google drive documents, images

So what I would want is once a week the program would take all the data and move it to a specified folder in an external hard drive. 
I don&#x27;t really care about duplication of data. I just want a snapshot of all my important data on disk so I can store the disks in offshore locations.<p>Is there any tool out there that can do this?<p>Or should I just code a solution myself?

33005343,Ask HN: What is the cost of unit test coverage in complex C++ projects,2022-09-28T07:56:49Z,jgaa,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"This question have been intriguing me for the past few weeks. A few project I&#x27;m involved in are supposed to get more unit test coverage. The project include some fault-tolerant distributed servers, proxies and various API proxies&#x2F;converters (between data query languages and protocols). Some of the components that needs to run really fast are written in C++, and are using threading and asynchronous requests between components (potentially in different data centers). Some of these components use asio&#x2F;beast and stackless and stackfull coroutines. Of course, most of the code is still trivial, sequential methods doing something well defined with a predictable outcome.<p>Articles and discussions on the net about the right balance for code coverage in unit tests are plentiful. But I have not found much relevant material about the actual cost of targeting say 50%, 70%, 90% or 99% unit test coverage. And it looks to me that most of the numbers regards interactive web pages and mobile apps. Not the more complex technology beneath. I&#x27;m not opposing testing - I think testing is great. I just want a realistic idea about the actual cost of various code coverage percentages in projects of some complexity.<p>My experience from smaller open source projects in modern C++ that I&#x27;ve written from scratch is that &quot;proper&quot; unit testing adds about 60 - 100% coding overhead (designing and writing the tests, and also being mindful about testing while designing and writing the actual code). I usually only test the public methods on an interface, unless there are some special reasons to test or access private methods. I try to avoid mocking. The aim of the unit test is to validate that the algorithm in a public method works as documented. Since some of these methods are interpreters with potentially indefinite variations in input, I&#x27;m testing for valid and invalid input, but only with a few workloads to test specific paths and error conditions in the code. The tests will typically catch logical regressions, but not security vulnerabilities or performance regressions. I have not used code coverage tools, but my gut feeling is that I typically cover &lt; 70% of my code in my small open source projects with unit tests.<p>All projects of this nature are unique, and increasingly asynchronous and parallel algorithms does, in my experience (may be I&#x27;m doing something wrong), increase unit testing complexity and the time needed to design the code and write the tests. In my opinion, it&#x27;s not acceptable to introduce performance regressions in hot paths in the code to facilitate testing (for example by using virtual classes in stead of templates).<p>So, with this language; C++ 17 (no, re-writing millions of lines of C++ code in Rust or Ruby is not an option right now) and this complexity (parallel and asynchronous algorithms in a fault-tolerant distributed system with massive disk&#x2F;network IO and capacity for billions of low latency external requests per day) - what could the cost-curve for unit test coverage &#x2F; coding time look like, from 50% to 99% code coverage?<p>Some people involved in the project are talking about &quot;100% unit test coverage&quot; as a target.<p>Note that I only focus on unit testing here. That&#x27;s because the other forms of testing in this project are done by different teams, and don&#x27;t have a direct impact on the time it takes to get a feature from a specification document to code complete. Also, please excuse my grammar ;) English is not my native language.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
