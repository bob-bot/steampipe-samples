I agreed to a new contract, which was published on a public URL for me to check and sign. The contract (which included my social security number, ID number, full name, date of birth, etc) was there for about a month; it was removed after I protested. I can&#x27;t tell for how long it would be there.<p>The second one, an international enterprise: After I asked for my data stored on their systems (they give you the option, no special request) they send me a public URL also. It included my ID photos. They were there for 3 months, according to their policy. As an international company, they were much more cumbersome (rather unwilling) to remove them before the time their policy dictates; to be honest, I doubt if I spoke to any human being, probably they were all bots. I can&#x27;t tell if my ID photos where publicly available after I asked my data or from the day I signed in.<p>Both companies answer was on the same basis: It&#x27;s a URL which is not searchable (no results for these kind of URLs from internet search engines) so since I&#x27;m the only one who has it, I&#x27;m the only one capable of accessing it.
I consider this to NOT be secure. Like having something valuable on a public road, but it&#x27;s a small road that no-one passes by; most probably, but not 100%, it won&#x27;t be stolen.<p>So my questions for anybody in the IT security or audit industry,<p>- how is it possible for this policy to be acceptable from major companies?<p>- Can it really be considered safe, a public URL; just because it&#x27;s long, no results returned from search engines, and send only to one person? Send by non-encrypted e-mail, so even if the rest of the chain would be secure, it could be breached through mail.<p>- If a malicious person (cracker, black hat hacker, whatever the terminology) or just a curious and very lucky person who tries many different URLs, access these data: Is there any way to persecute him&#x2F;her? He did nothing unlawful, He just opened a public URL.<p>My question to hackers, have you managed to access such personal data on enterprises URLs? Is it really tough to traverse their sites to locate them?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
