It&#x27;s free to try and only takes a few minutes to get set up [2] and run decision models [3] for vehicle routing, shift scheduling, packing problems, and Sudoku. Each model is customizable for constraints and objective functions [4]. We&#x27;re also adding things like MIP support.<p>You can also create something entirely custom. We build on top of our SDK regularly. (There&#x27;s an interesting PagerDuty scheduler we&#x27;ve built that we&#x27;ll share more about soon!)<p>We hope you try it out and we&#x27;re happy to answer any questions.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22630426"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22630426</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZldKkAYJIuo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZldKkAYJIuo</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nextmv.io&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;overview"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nextmv.io&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;overview</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextmv.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;model-and-solve-a-custom-vrp-using-software-paradigms-with-a-food-retailer-example"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nextmv.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;model-and-solve-a-custom-vrp-usin...</a>",story,https://docs.nextmv.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
