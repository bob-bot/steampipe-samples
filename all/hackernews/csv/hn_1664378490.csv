Every day I would wake up with a feeling of dread. I decided to quit.<p>Quitting was so hard. It challenged so many parts of my identity. Who is the person I wanted to be? What does success even mean? Was I just wrong about everything that I thought to be true?<p>5 years on, I’ve learned so much, and I’m still answering those questions. My thesis: living your best life = understanding your deep truths + having the courage to live that life. I still want to be a founder. And, perhaps selfishly, I want my work to help me along my journey too.<p>Like me six years ago, many of us have the ingredients to live a happy life: a decent job, close friends, and good health. But deep down, something isn’t right. Daily stressors, burnout, and exhaustion often get in the way of living our best lives.<p>With Kindred Minds, we are now creating a new, community-based approach to life coaching to tackle the roots of these problems. We want to help people build deeper self-awareness (understand their values, who they want to be, and obstacles in the way) and then equip them with frameworks (Enneagram, Wheel of Life, Values-Based Decision Matrix, Eulogy Exercise, etc.) to become a better version of themselves. We are cheaper ($149&#x2F;mo instead of $150-250&#x2F;session) and better (top-quality curriculum, greater accountability, strong community focus) than traditional 1:1 life coaching.<p>How it works
Once you sign up, we match you with a cohort of 8-10 people like you. Every other week you come together with that group + a peer-led facilitator for 90 min to discuss, connect, and learn. In between sessions, there is some prep work (content, exercises, reflections) to help you get the most out of the experience. We&#x27;re working w several certified coaches + learning experts to make sure we get this right.<p>I put together this video to further walk you through how it works: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kindredminds.com&#x2F;membership-invitation#how-it-works"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kindredminds.com&#x2F;membership-invitation#how-it-wo...</a><p>If you’d like to sign up, I’d love to offer the Hacker News community $100 of their first month using promo-code HACKERNEWS (expires Oct 5).
