I wanted to understand more about databases&#x27; internals so I wrote one from scratch.
It has a T-SQL inspired syntax with support for functions and procedures.
It can be used stand-alone as a SQL engine or with a server allowing for persistence and replication to other connected clients.<p>Performance are nothing near sqlite of course but that&#x27;s beside the point. It’s a small database engine that can run in a web app as a way to store session data, do small calculations on a web worker, store the document&#x2F;data the user is editing or facilitate “multiplayer” feature by broadcasting the queries the web app is running. The server runs in a container for that specific document and shutdowns automatically after a set amount of minutes of inactivity.<p>Why did I spend time on this? I am self taught and have been a software developer for about 20 years; moved to the UK for about 10 years, now in Spain and I&#x27;m still looking for the place I want to call home. My lack of diploma has never been an issue in Europe but if I want to discover other horizons, having one makes things easier. There&#x27;s a process in France call &quot;Validation des acquis&quot; (Validation of knowledge) which allows anybody at whatever level to present to a panel of professionals and academics a request to validate one experience and deliver a diploma. That diploma is completely equivalent to a diploma delivered from a university. The experience must validate all of the targeted diploma curriculum so I thought digging into databases will help with that...<p>Any questions, hate mail can be directed at alex at ixai.net.

Now you would not believe what happened last night, in fact, I’m still shocked about it and the rest of the Republicans we’re all shocked about it.<p>So you’ve been hearing probably about the Omnibus Bill that has been going through the Appropriations committee. This is a 1.5 Trillion dollar Omnibus Bill that none of us got to see anything in the bill, in the bill text. We had no idea what was in it until this morning when we found out that the Rules Committee, which is a Democrat Controlled Committee, they put out their basically, their alert on their website, they did not email any of us.<p>They put it on their website After Midnight. After Midnight, as in early this morning. They put it on their website, that the Rules Committee would be meeting at 1:30AM. 1:30AM! And that is where the Rules Committee meets to debate the Bill.<p>Now normally, and how Congress should work, and it doesn’t work this way since Pelosi has been Speaker, is an Appropriations Bill is something that every member of Congress can go and put Ammendments in, we can debate on the Bill, and then once it goes to Rules Committee that is where we can go and argue back and try to put ammendments and try to make changes.<p>So they meet in the Middle of the Night, the Dark of Night, the Democrat run Rules Committee met at 1:30AM in the morning and by 2:30AM, 2:30AM early this morning, they had PASSED the 1.5 Trillion Omnibus Bill and they released the Bill text.<p>So for all of us here in Washington when we woke up earlier this morning, we found out that it was TOO LATE to go in and try to put ammendments in, to try to argue back, try to get things removed from this horrendous absolutely horrendus 1.5 Trillion Spending Bill that is supposed to keep the Government, the Lights on, but we weren’t able to do that because the Democrats SNUCK IT THROUGH, literally snuck it through from 1:30AM in the morning to 2:30AM in the morning.<p>They did not tell us ahead of time, no one had any idea. Until they put it on THEIR website AFTER MIDNIGHT they posted it. So none of us knew. How were we supposed to know? This is NOT how Congress is supposed to work. It’s COMPLETELY BROKEN.<p>So when you look at our government and you are shocked and cannot believe the things that happen here in Washington DC, I am telling you THIS is how CORRUPT it is.<p>It is so Corrupt it is shocking.
