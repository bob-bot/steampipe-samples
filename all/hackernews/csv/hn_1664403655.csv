33013552,"IPv6 should concede to using v4 addresses, for now",2022-09-28T21:31:28Z,hot_gril,2,false,false,4,"[33013821,33013713]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"tl;dr everything that currently has a v4 address should have the same v6 address (with padding), in every kind of dual-stack network, to ease the transition<p>IPv6 is generally considered better and even simpler than v4. Slow adoption has usually been blamed on old systems, but I&#x27;m getting tired of that explanation. Currently, many networks are dual-stack, meaning both v4 and v6 are spoken on it totally independently. Not only is v4 still around, but the phrase &quot;IP address&quot; is generally understood to mean v4. Why is this still a thing?<p>First I considered the human side. Say a device&#x27;s IPv4 address is 71.177.17.171 (seriously I used to have this one). Maybe I also get v6 address 2345:0425:2CA1:::0567:5673:23b5. You&#x27;re telling me this eyesore of base16 and repeated colons is an upgrade? Even making it a longer octal like 71.177.17.171.77.111.11.11 would&#x27;ve been easier for most people. Yes, either way it&#x27;s just a number to the computer, but human-friendliness still matters (consider JSON).<p>When I mentioned this to some network expert colleagues over lunch (I&#x27;m no expert), they each said, the human-unfriendly v6 addresses are a <i>feature</i> to encourage use of DNS within an enterprise system. Something is wrong if you care about the address rather than just using DNS. DNS also solves the v4-&gt;6 migration. I get it, but doesn&#x27;t that sound user-hostile? If the benefit of switching from 4 to 6 is repeatedly too small for companies to justify in the short term, shouldn&#x27;t this be nicer?<p>So I asked, why is v4 still king if DNS can resolve to v6, and the answer confirmed my suspicion: It&#x27;s not a lack of hardware&#x2F;software support for v6. It&#x27;s all these old, shoddy systems with hardcoded peer ipv4 addresses within datacenters, enterprise setups, etc. Maybe a sensor hardcodes the controller address. And a v4 network will often include all sorts of middleware like NATs that you don&#x27;t put into a v6 network, so often everything changes going from 4 to 6. For companies that don&#x27;t need v6 today, the value proposition doesn&#x27;t make sense. I&#x27;m &quot;guilty&quot; of this at home too, setting static ipv4s for devices and disabling v6 entirely cause who needs it. v4 is king because v4 <i>addresses</i> are king.<p>The common enterprise workaround is predictable. Configure a 4-&gt;6 middlebox for legacy parts of the network, but of course that requires special configuration coding in the 4-&gt;6 address mapping. And in dual-stack networks, you get a confusing mix of v4 and v6 addresses. Even home networks and consumer ISPs are in that situation now. It&#x27;s a mess.<p>As we spoke at the lunch table, each person who sat down to join us left this insanely boring conversation within a minute.<p>So I had previously thought about shoving the v4 address into the v6 with some padding. Turns out there&#x27;s a spec* for this, but it&#x27;s optional. Here&#x27;s my proposition: In every dual-stack setup, make each host&#x27;s v6 address always the same as its v4 address (with padding). I don&#x27;t just mean within one company, I mean globally as part of the IP spec. Change ipv4 networks to speak v6, from ISPs to tiny subnets, but don&#x27;t change any addresses. Crappy old code just needs a protocol change, nothing else. Humans should even represent such padded v6 address in the v4 octal notation; don&#x27;t scare people with hexes. Your gateway is still 192.168.1.1, your DNS is 8.8.8.8, but you&#x27;re speaking v6. Then once everything is speaking v6, we can take the next steps with the critical mass of adoption put behind us. Maybe some v4-padded addresses will survive, but IPv4 won&#x27;t.<p>In some ways, this makes no technical sense. The address shouldn&#x27;t matter, and why use padded v4 addresses even in dual-stack networks that don&#x27;t have this problem of hardcoded addresses? Because this is less confusing, and it&#x27;s not about the technical perfection, it&#x27;s about getting people on the same page.<p>* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oracle.com&#x2F;cd&#x2F;E19683-01&#x2F;817-0573&#x2F;transition-4&#x2F;index.html",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
