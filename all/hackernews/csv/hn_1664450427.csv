I mainly use AWS which is far from perfect, but usually I can get it to do what I want. I&#x27;ve spent a very frustrating 2 days trying to get Microsoft to work and can&#x27;t.<p>Context: trying to do something super basic with the Microsoft Graph API -- retrieve calendar events for a specific user via a custom app.<p>I thought I could sign up, get an API key, and make a call.<p>There&#x27;s a nice guide here[0] that shows how to do this.<p>But microsoft has a _lot_ of moving parts. I have an Azure account with an active subscription, so I go through the steps and everything seems to work, but I get 401 unauthorized errors when actually trying to retrieve the events. I spend a few hours messing around with different user&#x2F;admin-level permissions but nothing helps.<p>Eventually I notice that the first step of the tutorial specifies that a pre-requisite is global admin access to a tenant. I thought I had that through Azure, but maybe I don&#x27;t? The link directs to Microsoft 365 Developer program, which asks me to create a sandbox account. It then rejects all my phone numbers. [1]<p>I try to go to the support page, which needs me to sign in. I get a server error when trying to sign in [1].<p>I eventually contact Azure support, who say they have no view of Microsoft 365 and can&#x27;t help at all (though it takes 2 hours of filling in a form and going through L1 support script on live chat to get to this point).<p>So<p>a) can anyone sign up for 365 developers [2] or is it b0rked for everyone?<p>b) can anyone sign into services hub [3] or is it b0rked for everyone?<p>c) it is normal that I need to deal with so many accounts and organizations to do something so simple?<p>To wit: I need an Azure account with active subscription, I need an Active Directory account to create the app, I need a 365 Developer account to get a sandbox, and I need a Support Account to get help. And internally, none of these orgs can talk to each other to figure out why I can&#x27;t programmatically read events from Outlook.<p>How does anyone actually working with this stuff professionally ever get anything done?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;training&#x2F;modules&#x2F;msgraph-access-user-events&#x2F;1-introduction<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.ritzastatic.com&#x2F;images&#x2F;55e8b6a2c48a43afb08dd31c3c4c4035&#x2F;micsup.png<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;microsoft-365&#x2F;dev-program?ocid=MSlearn&amp;WT.mc_id=m365-16105-cxa<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serviceshub.microsoft.com&#x2F;home",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

        if n &lt; 2 then n else Fib(n-2) + Fib(n-1)

Isn&#x27;t this just another <i>implementation</i> (a very slow one)?<p>Is every specification also an implementation?
