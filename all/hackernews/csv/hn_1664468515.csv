Many of us end up reading books by or about people of specific genders. So it&#x27;s interesting to find books that are outside that echo chamber but still mostly _inside_ the topical or affinity area we are most engaged in. Doing this, it helps us to each expand our reading while elevating underrepresented authors, topics and character-types in the books we read.<p>For myself, I found it most interesting to find more female writers in the topic area of economics and technology, where I&#x27;ve experienced a high concentration of male writers.<p>From the explainer:
.
Imagine sitting in a library of limited size, tailored perfectly to your tastes. If we look at all the books in this library, the genders of their authors, and the genders of characters within the books, then we can find your &quot;literary gender bias&quot;. That&#x27;s what this tool attempts to do. Giving the tool 3-5 books can serve as the seeds of this hypothetical library. From these, we can then extrapolate, calculate and show you your gender bias, and a set of recommendations that seek to invert that bias.",story,https://abooklikefoo.com/genecho,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

As everyone I think it also has a nice market fit and with some work I should be able to develop a full product and find a few customers. Though, I am not a sales guy and I think someone with sales expertise would definitely help to push it forward. Hence, I got in touch with another small company and they suggested that I (including the prototype) join their company as CTO. The company offers consulting in the same area and consists mainly of one freelancer who engages other freelancers depending on the projects. I know him from previous business and some of the freelancers as well so they are not complete strangers. I suggested to found a new company to clearly separate it from the previous work but they stated that it would be too much effort.<p>Now I am a bit unsure how to approach the situation:
- should I insist to found a new company? how would you split the equity in that case? is there any best practice?
- what would you demand in case I would decide to join as CTO? Equity? Since it&#x27;s already an established company it has a certain value but the value is actually only based on the current&#x2F;previous consulting gigs which makes it kind of difficult. Also, I don&#x27;t know what happened in the past and do not know if the company has any liabilities.
- if I join them, how can I &quot;protect&quot; the code so they cannot simply fire me afterwards and take it for them? how can I ensure that I can still use the code afterwards?
- is the code really worth anything at the moment?<p>Thanks for your insights!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
