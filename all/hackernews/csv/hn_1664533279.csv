33032851,"Angular Nation community nearly doubles, following collaboration with AG Grid",2022-09-30T09:40:11Z,kcentropy,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"London: Wednesday 30th September 2022 – Angular Nation, the free and private community for Angular developers, has announced 53 per cent year-over-year growth, with its community increasing from 2,956 users in September 2021, to 4520 users in September 2022. 
A key milestone for the company arrived in the form of a major collaboration with leading datagrid provider AG Grid, in September 2021. As part of the collaboration, AG Grid is an official sponsor of Angular Nation, and recognises it as the leading community for discussion, support, and resource access relevant to Angular and Typescript projects. Since working together, the Angular Nation community has doubled in size, in part due to the increased awareness bought to the community from AG Grid’s established userbase.<p>In addition to our premium channels, support from AG Grid allows us to offer many benefits completely free, including courses, workshops, and live events where Angular beginners can get help and support with no strings attached. Once these developers gain a solid understanding of Angular, we help match them up with companies who are searching for skilled Angular developers.<p>Angular Nation was set up by Bonnie Brennan in 2021 to give Angular developers a dedicated learning space, where they can discuss their projects, access free webinars, courses and Q&amp;A sessions with leading Angular experts surrounding the current eco-system, and resources and tools on offer.<p>Bonnie Brennan the founder of Angular Nation, commented:<p>“Our goal for Angular Nation was to create a friendly and supportive place where even introverts would feel comfortable turning on their cameras to participate. It started slow at first but now we’re growing faster! We’re starting to attract more sponsors but we will never forget AG Grid, who believed in us and supported us from the beginning.”<p>Niall Crosby, CEO of AG Grid commented:<p>“Angular is a framework which is growing in popularity, and before Angular Nation came along, the community was crying out for better access to resources and more learning support. Not only does Angular Nation fulfil this quota, but as a community, it aligns itself very well with the ambitions and outlook of AG Grid. In fact, we are on of the only datagrid providers ourselves who offer Angular native datagrid compatability.<p>“This is why we were more than keen to become an official sponsor to Angular Nation, and will continue to work alongside them to bring better awareness and improve access and support for Angular developers.”<p>ENDS<p>About Angular Nation 
Angular Nation is a free, private community for Angular developers.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.angularnation.net&#x2F;<p>About AG Grid<p>At AG Grid, our mission is simple: Build the best datagrid in the world.
Born out of frustration with existing solutions, AG Grid evolved from a side project to becoming the leading JavaScript datagrid on the market. We are a company built by developers for developers, and - true to our roots - we offer AG Grid Community: a free and open-source project that delivers world class grid performance. AG Grid Enterprise is our commercially-licensed offering which has enjoyed widespread adoption and facilitates us to keep delivering on our mission.<p>Our story is proof that necessity is the mother of invention. During his time working in London-based financial institutions, Niall Crosby - founder and CEO - struggled to find any datagrid component that could deliver the performance required in tandem with a complete feature list. This struggle ultimately led Niall to pulling out the keyboard one Christmas holiday period and starting AG Grid as a side project. This was then released as open source and quickly developed a following.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
