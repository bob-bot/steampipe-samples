At our company, Bit Complete [1], we use Airtable a bunch for managing operations. We really like how easy it is to throw up a form to collect information, or to build automations for offline processing like aggregations.<p>One challenge we kept running into was how to build more complicated interactive apps using the API, while maintaining fine-grained access control to Airtable data. Airtable ties identity to API access control via API keys, which makes it very hard to build apps with realistic access control needs.
So we built AirQL! [2]<p>It’s a utility layer between Airtable’s API and custom&#x2F;internal web applications that supports Google authentication and flexible access control.<p>We’ve found that it makes it practical to build simple, useful internal apps, that still benefit from everything else Airtable has to offer.<p>If this sounds interesting, check out the docs [3], try out the product, and let us know what you think! We’re looking for feedback and to learn if this would be useful to others.

Sep 9 (24h later) - nothing. So we replied to the message as instructed.
Sep 12 - still nothing. One more reply sent. Asked some of our customers to report our site as safe.
Sep 15 - crickets. Tried calling phone support, impossible to get through; they just hang up on us. Reached out to MS support on Twitter, said they would look into the case.
Sep 22 - no changes - MS twitter support has been unable to find the correct person internally. We replied to the SmartScreen ticket once more. Opened two new tickets. Asked more customers to report the site as safe.
Sep 30 (Today) - now the warning has started to spread from our login page to our entire dashboard.
