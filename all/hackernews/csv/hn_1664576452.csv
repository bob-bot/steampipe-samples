After a few back and forth emails, I logged into my reseller console, which allows me to administer my customers&#x27; domains... but the customer&#x27;s domain was not in the list.<p>The customer was getting a generic error when trying to access admin.google.com - please contact your domain administrator (me). When I tried to log in, their domain was simply not in the list of customers.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve been on countless live chats, phone calls and email threads with Google support, but nobody&#x27;s listening. Every time I get passed to another person, I have to explain everything from the start again, and I&#x27;m pointed to a Google Forms page to submit my &quot;I can&#x27;t access my account&quot; request. Submitting the form doesn&#x27;t do anything.<p>In fact, the support feels like I&#x27;m being trialled on teaching some kind of defective AI how to discuss problems with my Google account, or maybe I&#x27;m communicating via Google Translate to a non-English speaking sweatshop?<p>Anyway, my customer has been waiting to add a user for 3 months now, and they&#x27;re getting shirty - possible legal issues are coming my way because of my incompetance.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know what to do. Google have just pulled the plug on a customer, and now I&#x27;m in hot water with nobody to talk to.<p>Has anyone got any advice?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Plus remove certain core functionality like more advance logic that would go into a method that cant be simple getters and setters in that struct package.<p>The other issue I contend with is that in doing so it just doesn&#x27;t &quot;feel&quot; like idiomatic Go. For the many years I have been using Go both core package and open source ones(big and small) and I just don&#x27;t see many cases where packages completely pull their main structs out. I also try to think about what more advanced developers would do like Rob Pike(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PAAkCSZUG1c&amp;t=568s), Brad Fitzpatrick, Russ Cox, I assume they wouldn&#x27;t think this is a good idea. Presenting various example and quotes from core Go developers didn&#x27;t seem to sway them.<p>Does anyone have experience in this area? Has anyone pulled their main structs out and have been better off for it? Has anyone pulled them out and then realized it was bad and moved them all back?<p>What are your thought?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
