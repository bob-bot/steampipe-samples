33044375,Ask HN: Course/Book for creating desktop apps in C#,2022-10-01T06:22:45Z,auraham,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I am interested in creating a desktop application in C#, maybe a simple point-of-sales system for a local store.
I used C# back in 2012 for creating some GUI apps but the language has changed a lot since then.
Given that, can you recommend a book or course for learning C# in 2022?<p>Relevant topics
- Creating a Desktop app (forms, not Web app) for Windows (it does not need to be cross-platform)
- ADO.NET, I want to populate a data grid in a form. I think Entity Framework is the new cool stuff, so I would like to learn it.
- Packaging an app for distribution.
- Best practices for developing GUI applications (ie how to separate the business logic and the data layer)<p>So far I&#x27;ve found these resources:<p>- [1] Programming C#: Building .NET Applications with C# (English Edition). It seems to cover most of the topics I am interested in. However, it is a bit outdated. Not sure if the content is still relevant.
- [2] Murach&#x27;s C# (7th Edition). This seems to be an interesting book. However, I am not familiar with Murach&#x27;s books. Also, the book is a bit pricey.
- [3] Code Like a Pro in C#. This also seems interesting. The author teaches by refactoring a legacy .NET codebase instead of creating an app from scratch. He also focuses on creating a service instead of a desktop app.
- [4] C# in Depth. Jon Skeet&#x27;s book. Maybe too specialized.<p>I am also open to video curses in the same tone as the Pragmatic Studio [5].<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Programming-Building-Applications-Jesse-Liberty-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B0028N4W7O&#x2F;ref=sr_1_2
