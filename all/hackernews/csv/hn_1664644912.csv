Now we create a file and stage it for addition:<p><pre><code>  git-test$ echo content &gt; file
  git-test$ git add file

We can see it in the dir listing, of course:<p><pre><code>  git-test$ ls
  file

And see the diff between the stage and the index, which adds the file:<p><pre><code>  git-test$ git diff --cached
  diff --git a&#x2F;file b&#x2F;file

After some feedback though, we found out that the biggest problem of our target users is managing their wishlists.<p>74% of people who buy online maintain some kind of wishlist to keep track of things that they want to buy but they end up creating too many lists across multiple sites. There&#x27;s no easy way for them to consolidate it so they forget items and lose out on deals.<p>We (re)built ShopMe to address just that. You can create a universal wishlist - add individual items via product links or barcodes and even import WHOLE wishlists from most major ecommerce sites (just make sure they&#x27;re public). Get price drop notifications and when you&#x27;re ready to order, just put it in your ShopMe cart and order with one click (even with multiple items across different sites).<p>We were in private beta for a few months but we just launched on Product Hunt. If you&#x27;re the type that has multiple wishlists, do try it out!",story,https://www.getshopme.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
