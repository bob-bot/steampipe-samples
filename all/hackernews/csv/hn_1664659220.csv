I&#x27;m very comfortable in that sphere but feel like I&#x27;m stagnating; there isn&#x27;t scope in my current workplace to use anything else and it&#x27;s all pretty standard stuff.<p>I want to move to a different stack. This is for both professional growth—to learn new ways of doing things which might lead me to working more effectively—as well as for personal growth. I&#x27;ve found some other technologies and areas that excite me and which I really <i>want</i> to be a part of.<p>Senior positions using other stacks understandably require several years of experience; those I&#x27;ve applied for have resulted in rejections at the application stage. Some substantial demo projects in my portfolio would be great but I struggle to find time outside of work these days.<p>Junior positions don&#x27;t have sufficient compensation given my family needs and have fewer or none of the other responsibilities I enjoy such as team management and project ownership.<p>I&#x27;m hoping my exact transition isn&#x27;t relevant for receiving advice, to make it useful for others in similar situations, but some examples of transitions might be:<p>- Backend web services written in Python to those written in languages with substantially different paradigms, e.g. Elixir.
- Consumer-oriented web APIs to real-time services, e.g. fintech.
- Backend web services to a hyper-focused subset of that, e.g. database engineering or operations.<p>What advice do you have on transitioning from one stack to another?

The Crowd List is a constantly updated directory of every startup, or established company, that is running an equity crowdfunding campaign. It’s too difficult to search every funding portal, every single day, to find out who is raising. We’ve consolidated that list into one place so you can learn which companies are looking for investors like you!<p>How does it work? 
When you sign up for The Crowd List you will have 24&#x2F;7 access to the constantly updated directory of equity crowdfunding campaigns.<p>Who is it for?
Anyone who is interested in investing. Give it a try!<p>Thank you for your support!",story,https://www.thecrowdlist.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
