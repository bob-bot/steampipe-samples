In my last question i asked &quot;How can I come to peace with the years I wasted on pointless things?&quot;. The overwhelming number of answers in that thread really helped me. Since then my mind is a bit calmer, and my mental health is more stable. Now, this improvement is probably more due to start taking the correct medication around the same time i made the thread, but i do believe the variety, the diversity, but also uniformity of the answers helped me to put some things into perspective and changed my thinking.<p>From that point on I took the opportunity to make some small, but crucial changes in my every day life. Some change are: Thinking what i want my daily life to look like, what i have space for in my life, introducing rules on how i spend my time, stop using SM platforms, or limiting  the usage to bare minimum for the platforms i need to have some access, exercising and more. The book &quot;Digital minimalism&quot; by Cal Newport informs my efforts. I highly recommend it.<p>Now, the reason i make this thread is because i have noticed that i «forgot» how to think and engage with others. What i mean by that, assuming that i once knew how to do these things, currently i feel i can&#x27;t think, It&#x27;s like my mind has become passive, just consuming without processing. I have difficulties with evaluating information when reading articles or when i participate in conversations, a lot of times i feel my mind blank like i have nothing to say (in serious and non-serious conversations), having difficulty forming opinions besides on basic black and white topics. Another example that i realized fairly recently is that i don&#x27;t evaluate a comment, a post, etc on my own but rely on others opinions with the comments, upvotes&#x2F;downvotes, shadowbanning, etc they do.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
