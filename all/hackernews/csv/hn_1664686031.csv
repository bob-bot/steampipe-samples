33052886,Old and Confused Dev,2022-10-02T04:34:30Z,rlndb,1,false,false,1,[33052924],<null>,<null>,<null>,"hey HN! I&#x27;ll be 35 in 2 months, recently became a dad and am a little confused about what&#x27;s next in terms of my career.<p>My background: having no formal education I started out working in classic IT (fixing Windows related errors on client laptopts) for 6 years. Picked up programming &amp; started tinkering with linux as a hobby, which led me to become a sysadmin&#x2F;devops for 5 years. Eventually I became a backend developer mostly working in GO. My company had a merger, new teams were created and for the last year my title has been ML engineer. I even started tech leading this year. My company loves me, they&#x27;re telling me regularly.<p>But I feel like all I&#x27;m doing is gluing together AWS services, and even though I&#x27;m busy I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m being challenged. Because of that about 3 months ago I started studying in my free time. As I said I have no formal education, so things like system design are all new to me. I&#x27;m going through the  MIT 6.824: Distributed Systems course which is a blast! I also started learning Rust and learning about low level stuff, and wrote a couple CLI apps. Also spent time strengthening my DS &amp; algo skills.<p>I don&#x27;t have a clear idea though where to go next, and based on my study list you can tell I&#x27;m a bit all over the place. Learning about all these new things got me super excited though. I have this voice inside me that says I should specialize in a particular domain &amp; the tech around it. And I need to do it NOW since I&#x27;m considered &quot;old&quot; as a dev. I&#x27;m also embarrassed that it took me this long to get to the point where I&#x27;m at.
My questions: 
 - is it reasonable to specialize in something like distributed systems, or all most of the problems solved at this point? 
 - If I decide to go the route of systems programming, would companies even consider me with my background? Like I write python during the day, but will they care that I dedicate all my free time to other techs&#x2F;languages?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
