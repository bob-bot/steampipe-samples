( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Joseph_Engelberger )<p>Joe travelled to the world, visiting a lot of industrial sites. When he came back to the Danbury headquarters he would stop by my desk for a while. We talked about various &quot;wild ideas&quot; that Unimation might pursue. I was &quot;just a guy in the research department&quot; (there were only 2 of us) but we had great fun discussing ideas.<p>For example, Joe visited a brick manufacturing site. Bricks are stacked in a certain pattern on a pallet to let them cool. Could a Unimate stack those bricks? The issue was that a Unimate had very limited memory and there was not enough to encode all of the brick locations. We talked about using a PDP 11&#x2F;03 to drive the robot (I had just got that working in the lab).<p>Joe was &quot;an idea man&quot;, always imagining the next practical thing. He wanted &quot;real automation&quot;, not blue sky things. They had to work, they had to be useful, and they had to be made in industrial volumes.<p>Elon is the same sort of person. He&#x27;s not just building a robot. He&#x27;s building a &quot;real automation&quot; robot, one that works, is useful, and made in industrial volumes.<p>This class of problems is hard. It is easy to be critical if you&#x27;re not the person trying to solve the problem. Having worked in robotics, I have to say I&#x27;m impressed with his robot.<p>I could only wish to have Elon stop by my desk with these kind of ideas.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
