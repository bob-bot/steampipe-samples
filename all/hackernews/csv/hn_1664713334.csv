(Moire pattern occur when the fillfactor of the kernel is less that unity, the generalized Sampling Limit is beholden to the spatial frequency of the &quot;gaps&quot; rather than the actual sample interval)<p>Since a square pixel generally projects a trapizoid onto the texture surface, it takes only four points to determine the list of texels being integrated within that trapizoid (Think Starcraft 2&#x27;s minimap frame), in which case we could simply reverse-rasterize it into a &quot;texel fragment&quot; that is the union between the trapizoid-footprint and polygon boundary, and just average up the values.<p>Why then do anisotropic filtering need to send out multiple probes, when four would suffice and the resulting fragment is contiguous data anyways? It seems like all these extra complexity arise simply working with the texel-aligned grid rather than the pixel-projected coordinates?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
