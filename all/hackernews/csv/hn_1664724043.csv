If you want to detect a new type of object, like a horse, you have to collect and label images with horses and retrain your model.<p>A <i>zero-shot</i> object detection model is a so-called open-vocabulary model: it can detect a huge number of object categories without needing to retrain it. These categories are not predefined: you can provide any free-form text query like “yellow boat” and the model will attempt to detect objects that match that description.<p>Zero-shot object detection models like OWL-ViT are trained on massive datasets of image-text pairs, often scraped from the internet. The heavy lifting is done by a CLIP-based image classification network trained on 400 million image-text pairs, and adapted to work as an object detector. The largest model took 18 days to train on 592 V100 GPUs.<p>We used the Hugging Face implementation [2] of the OWL-ViT model and deployed it to a cloud GPU. Inference takes about 300ms, making interactive exploration possible: make sure to tweak the text queries and thresholds to find the ones that work best for your images!<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2205.06230"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2205.06230</a>
