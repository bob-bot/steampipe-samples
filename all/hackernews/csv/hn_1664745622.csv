33060198,Ask HN: Is realtime functionality of Firebase and Supabase DBs any useful?,2022-10-02T20:58:43Z,harshitjain007,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"In my understanding, Firebase Realtime Database can sync the data to the mobile clients only when the app is in foreground and not in killed&#x2F;background state. This needs developers to handle the killed&#x2F;background app case separately, and send a push notification to the device (e.g. chat notification). For the right UX, the push notification should only be sent to the apps in killed&#x2F;background state. So, to detect whether the app is in the foreground or killed&#x2F;background state, the server will need to maintain a WebSocket connection with every foreground running app. But doesn&#x27;t this defeat the purpose of using Realtime Database, as the WebSocket itself can be used to sync data now?
