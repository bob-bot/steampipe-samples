I have a workable background in graphics&#x2F;vision. However, as I am approaching the end of my degree, the industry has changed a lot. Most of the work depends on NeRF and diffusion. Now, I can stay relevant by studying these methods, but I am too tired of running in the rat race. I want to focus my career to be a 3D software engineer. Where do I start? All my experiences so far are in applied research. I enjoy it but burnout is really high for me with these roles. How do I change to software engineering?<p>Before I had a clear goal to be a research scientist. Now it is about being a 3D software engineer. Do you have any tips to make the switch?<p>Thank you.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
