33065158,Show HN: We designed and implemented graph projection feature,2022-10-03T09:22:39Z,nito98,11,false,false,<null>,[33065173],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi all! I&#x27;m one of the developers that were working on this project for some time. In recent months, users started to ask us more frequently about the ability to run algorithms on a part of graph stored in database - subgraph. Now to do this, we extended the implementation of C API we had and brought to you the graph project feature that enables running algorithms on a specific subset of a graph stored in the database.<p>You can now do graph analysis with PageRank, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, or any other algorithm on subgraphs without any additional adjustments. Before you had to create new query procedure. You can fire up a graph machine learning algorithm, such as Temporal graph networks and split the dataset inside the query to do training and validation without splitting the dataset programmatically. And last but not least, you can use your graphics card to run one of cuGraph&#x27;s algorithms on subgraph in terms of seconds.<p>You can find the whole explanation in blog post [1] and you can checkout the code at Memgraph GitHub [2]. Furthermore you can check cuGraph&#x27;s algorithms we have integrated [3]<p>I&#x27;d like to hear your feedback on our approach.

I am excited to share Hadmean with you all for feedback and early adoption.<p>What: Hadmean is an open-source, no-code internal tool generator.<p>Why: Most internal tool generators make you build from the ground up i.e you get a blank canvas, drag and drop and wire components to satisfy your business requirement. This I believe has many problems.
- They require some technical know-how.
- They require some learning curve.
- They require time to build and maintain.
- You duplicate a lot of business logic already in your database.<p>How: Hadmean attempts internal tool generation with a new approach by introspecting your database and building a multi-page application based on all the info it can find like your fields types, relationships, constraints etc. It is really cool. You literally will have your admin app done under 1 min without any tutorial or SQL.<p>Hadmean is also fully customizable, you can turn on&#x2F;off every feature you see in the UI within the UI.<p>Quick features
- Minimalist Setup - Just `npx hadmean@latest`
- Users Management
- Roles and permission
- CRUD
- Relationships
- Table Views
- Form validations
- Awesome and powerful filters
- Primitive dashboard builder
- Powerful multi-page navigation system
- Pleasantly looking<p>Here is demo link (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hadmean-demo.up.railway.app"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hadmean-demo.up.railway.app</a>)<p>Hadmean is currently in alpha but our our current features are pretty much stable and we are still adding more features and integrations to help you handle more business requirements seamlessly.",story,https://github.com/hadmean/hadmean,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
