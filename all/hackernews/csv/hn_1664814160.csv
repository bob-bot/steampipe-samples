33069145,Show HN: Subify subscription – Process of research and developing a new product,2022-10-03T15:46:55Z,ponchsava,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi everyone. This is Reza, Growth manager at Subify,
About two years ago, we released our first app on Shopify. An app called “Hengam Restock&quot; helped merchants inform their customers that their products are back in stock. In 2 years, more than 200,000 products were back-in-stock through our app, and customers were notified. This method worked for the stores and increased their sales by more than 15%, but we were looking for a way that could help them sell better and solve their other problems, like inventory management. We searched for a few weeks and found a good solution. <i>Subscription</i>. If the stores could sell their products on a subscription basis, there would be no need to guess how many products to keep in the warehouse. Before that, this number could be much less than the required amount or more than the required amount. Each of these has its problems. With this method, they know with a good approximation how many people will buy a product next month, and they supply the same amount of stock. On the other hand, they can even guess how much income they will have next month and spend accordingly.
At that time, there were several apps for this work in Shopify, but these apps had several fundamental problems.
 1. Working with these apps was not easy; sometimes, merchants needed to hire a third party to help them use these apps.
 2. They were costly and intended only for large stores, while This problem was also the problem of small and medium stores and they needed this product too. 
3. A store&#x27;s needs in the subscription can be very diverse. Some want to create a subscription box, some need a landing page for subscription products, some want a membership and loyal customer club, etc. These apps did not have strong support, subscription knowledge, and customer success manager to help the merchant in these ways. At best, there was simple support that only dealt with fundamental problems.
 All of this made us think of creating our subscription app; thus, the &quot;Subify subscription&quot; was born. The app is simple, and everyone can easily use it; it has a reasonable price, and merchants can start working without paying any initial amount. In addition to this, Subify subscription support surprisingly responds to your messages in less than 1 minute, and experienced customer success managers are by your side to make sure you succeed :)
Now Subify subscription has experienced tremendous growth in a short time, reached the rank of 300 out of 7000 apps, and serves many customers, including Shopify Pluses. Let us know what you think of our app and how we can make it a better resource by taking a look at it.",story,https://apps.shopify.com/subify-subscriptions,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
