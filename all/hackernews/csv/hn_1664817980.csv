At any moment he picks the camera to take a shot, its not a problem, but when he&#x2F;she continuously post on social media and keeps refreshing to see the number of impressions they got, that’s a problem. Being happy and feeling valued.. that’s a disaster.<p>IG, TK, Snapchat (and to some extent, FB -in some parts of the world-) are mostly based on people sharing their private lives to the public which does hurt everybody -alike-. Makers are losing their private lives in exchange for money and exposure, they suffer from countless psychological and mental issues by trying to be at their best just for their audience, even if it is FAKE and is far from being the reality. On the other hand, Fans are dying of jealousy of their “idols&#x2F;influencers”, resulting in self-underestimation, self-hate and.. I just can’t believe it, “suicide-thoughts”, Yes. People, or more precisely, teen girls, had even thought to put an end to their lives.. why? Just to end the suffering inside because.. you know the rest.<p>And you know what? The newcomer, BeReal. While it appears it has a plan to fix some [or all] of the above-mentioned issues, it still has, IMHO, a fundamental issue, which is, keeping people taking photos of themselves [at random times in the day without preparing] and publish them publicly, or privately. Again, this is the core idea all the platforms are based on, so, this rewind us to the title above.<p>On the other part of the equation are “Phone Makers”, maybe the lion’s share of their keynotes is dedicated to the camera, the top-of-the-show. AI, MegaPixels, Stabilization.. are some of the buzz words being “stressed” during the show. “The most advanced camera system ever in an iPhone”, “S23 Ultra is rumored to have an unbelievable 200MP.. you count it..”<p>It’s like our lives are being reduced to a 1cm-square device! Life is being minified as “life.min.cam”<p>Maybe I am stuck in a “prehistoric life”, thus I’m unable to understand how all this is being mainstream.<p>Maybe my brain’s hardware is outdated in a way it couldn’t upgrade the soft inside to the latest stable release of modern life.<p>Maybe I am completely wrong about this.. like driving your car, by mistake, in the opposite direction while in a new city.<p>I just wanted to share some words..",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
