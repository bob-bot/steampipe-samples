By now, I&#x27;ve noticed what kinds of imbalances exist in interviews and can list things to study that come up more than they should in general SWE coding interviews.<p>1. DFS&#x2F;BFS, both recursive and iterative form. Iterative version is usually better because it&#x27;s easier to incorporate the Q&#x27;s gimmick into it, plus they might grill you on Python&#x27;s max call depth. Honestly, these <i>are</i> important in real work, but I&#x27;ve had an interview day where every single algo question was basically DFS.<p>2. Trie. It&#x27;s niche, but I&#x27;ve seen a silly number of questions that are super easy with a trie and super hard without one. Should be banned IMO cause it almost purely tests textbook knowledge.<p>3. Dynamic programming (DP), and its cousin memoized recursion. The harder interview questions will require this. Memoization is usually easier, but I&#x27;ve seen some interviewers insist on DP.<p>4. Text parsing. Use a finite state machine, or it&#x27;ll get ugly quickly. Say you&#x27;re parsing XML like &lt;tag&gt;value&lt;&#x2F;tag&gt;, make an enum of states OPENING_TAG, READING_VALUE, CLOSING_TAG, loop through one char at a time, and add an entirely separate branch for each state in the loop.<p>5. Java OOP memes. They&#x27;ll especially ask what an abstract class is for some reason. I don&#x27;t know why this is still a thing.<p>6. Distributed hashmaps. If the interview involves concurrent or distributed algos, it will probably be a modified hashmap of some kind.<p>7. Different from all the above, I&#x27;ve been interviewed for many &quot;reliability&#x2F;production engineer&quot; type roles (and taken none of them).
