I&#x27;m studying CS at a mid-ranked program of a US university, where I have an option to do a 1-year master&#x27;s degree after my undergraduate degree is complete. I could also try to do a master&#x27;s degree at a higher-ranked CS program, or skip it and get a job. Is the extra degree worth it? (either in terms of career options or educational value).<p>Other things:
 - I&#x27;ve done some internships; I expect I&#x27;ll be able to get a job after I graduate.
 - I&#x27;m considering trying to move to Europe within a few years of graduating. Would the degree be more valuable there?

After several days of this, I&#x27;d like to graph my estimation error over time, to see the effect of practice on my performance. I could even try varying certain treatments, like caffeine or chattering background noise, to test their effects on my estimation error, after adjusting for the practice effect.<p>Some Fermi problems are straightforward to verify - the classic &quot;piano tuners in Chicago&quot; was answered with a phone book. Others can only be verified with another expert&#x27;s estimate, and the question might be too obscure for an Internet search to yield an instance where an expert had already done the math. I think I need a source of Fermi problems that I know a priori to be verifiable.<p>* To verify that a question has a solution, I usually have to do a Google search, which exposes me to the answer.<p>* If I search for a new one each day, I fear I would quickly become biased towards selecting easier questions.<p>* If, before starting the experiment, I cobble results together across many Google searches that seem likely to be verifiable, I fear I would have more days to dwell on the ones I do later in the experiment, exaggerating the practice effect.<p>Does anyone have any advice?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
