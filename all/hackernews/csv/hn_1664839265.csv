Sometimes we expect it and so order a few sizes of the same thing. Actually, about 1&#x2F;3 of all the clothing ordered online is returned, and half of that is due to poor sizing. Dealing with those returns is a huge waste of our time, not to mention the losses from unsellable garments and round-trip shipping.<p>Ember’s goal is to eliminate returns altogether. It’s a Chrome extension that takes a set of your measurements, compares them to the garment dimensions (schematics for each piece of clothing made), and then selects the size most likely to fit you best. Right now, it works on Everlane.com, and I plan to add more stores with time.<p>Usually, you have to sign up and share your measurements to use Ember. But, I made a test account so you can easily give it a whirl. Simply use the credentials below, navigate to Everlane.com, and see for yourself :)<p>user: test@addember.com
