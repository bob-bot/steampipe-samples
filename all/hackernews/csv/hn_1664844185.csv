Once logged in you can buy V-Bucks for Fortnite.  However, if you buy V-Bucks for Fortnite while logged in using your Nintendo Switch Account they don&#x27;t actually transfer to your Nintendo Switch Account.<p>Does this make sense?<p>So, I did this for my son 3 times.  The first time they didn&#x27;t show up right away, so I rebooted his Switch and then the V-Bucks showed up.  I did it a second time...they didn&#x27;t show up  even after a reboot.  I reached out to customer service, and they did transfer them.  I figured it was a network issue or something.  I did it a 3rd time.  The 3rd time the customer service person said they won&#x27;t transfer them, and they have a policy of only doing that once.  What!?<p>Epic Games, please get it together.  This policy and website bug make you look ridiculous.  Either disallow logins for Nintendo Switch, or fix the transfer issue.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
