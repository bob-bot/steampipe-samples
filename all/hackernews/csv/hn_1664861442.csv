33076899,Ask HN: Knowledge Base Writers / Hugo writers. Share your setup and wisdom,2022-10-04T05:17:58Z,dv35z,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN crew -<p>I&#x27;m putting together a &quot;local notes --&gt; publishable knowledge-base site&quot; workflow (it&#x27;s a git-versioned Hugo site which sits in an iCloud folder. I&#x27;m using iA Writer as the main writing IDE. When ready to publish (on iPhone&#x2F;iPad), I use Working Copy to commit &amp; push the changes, and then GitLab Pages builds &amp; publishes the site. It&#x27;s a new setup for me - but works pretty well. Happy to share details if anyone is interested in the setup.<p>Questions &#x2F; Issues<p>- How to Cross-link while in the writing flow (e.g. Notion-style linking). What I want to do, is to be able to quickly stub out [[Important Ideas]], and over time expand those entries into pages. But it seems I&#x27;ve got to figure out ways to translate [[ ]] topics into links when publishing out to Hugo. What&#x27;s the best way to do this? I see there are Hugo Shortlinks - but those look like a pain to write out frequently...<p>- Renaming &amp; &quot;shaping&quot; content over time - Sometimes I change the name of a page - I&#x27;d love to be able to update entires all over the site (I believe Obsidian keeps track of file names? Can iA Writer? Right now, when writing, I have no idea when I create a broken link. What&#x27;s the latest on automatic link integrity checkers. Is there a tool which could fail to publish my site if it included a broken link?<p>- How would you recommend adding photos to content? I haven&#x27;t figured out how to get &#x2F;topic&#x2F;foo&#x2F;photo-of-foo.jpg to appear in &#x2F;topic&#x2F;foo&#x2F;foo-notes when published? For example, in iA Writer, I&#x27;ll import an image, it seems to save the image saved in the same directory as the text content. I can preview it in iA Writer and the image appears, but when I publish to Hugo, I&#x27;m guessing that Hugo is not referring to the image correctly?? Apologies that&#x27;s vague - but the gyst is, &quot;out of the box&quot;, it seems like I&#x27;ve got to &quot;sort out how to embed images&quot;. I often will start a page on my phone - a few quick text notes, a few images... will publish it, and them come back a few days later to expand on it. Just want that &quot;publish some text and pictures&quot; flow to be easy.<p>- Somewhat related - What&#x27;s the current &quot;best practices&quot; on where to put related files (e.g. photos, diagrams, videos, etc that accompany or are embedded in a document). I am considering setting up a dedicated media.example.com. I&#x27;d love to have a local folder of files, and have it atomatically sync to an S3 bucket or something, which serves &#x2F;&lt;topic&gt;&#x2F;&lt;subtopic&gt;&#x2F;{photos, videos, audio, pdfs, etc}. On the content page, it could refer to those image links absolutely. Still.. frustrating having to make a whole separate &quot;tree&quot;.<p>- What do you suggest for site search? I want it to feel as quick as Mac&#x27;s Spotlight search, where it starts autocompleting suggestions.<p>- Other stuff: Can anyone suggest their favorite &quot;good out of the box&quot; Hugo themes? I&#x27;ve got to make several microsites, and I&#x27;d like to arrive to a few themes which are a &quot;safe default&quot;<p>Thank you for any advice.
