I studied graphic design in the BFA program back at San Jose State University.<p>After years as a freelance graphic designer, I noticed that most of my clients couldn&#x27;t distinguish a good design from a better one! I interviewed my clients, and 90% of them told me the only way they could identify a designer professional or not wasn&#x27;t by their work but by their project management and communication abilities.<p>That was the A-ha moment in my graphic design career because most freelance graphic designers were not good at managing projects, designing, and sales simultaneously. It would help many freelance designers if I built a project management tool specifically for them!<p>Freelance designers usually spend at least five meetings to confirm a design direction; we automate the process through survey templates.
Projects may fail or delay if they don&#x27;t grab clients&#x27; intention accurately and fast enough. Our survey system allows freelance designers to be more productive, leading to client satisfaction and sales!<p>I invite you to sign up at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;service.dotbrand.design&#x2F;users&#x2F;signup and give us feedback!<p>The invitation code: kevinvite1",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
