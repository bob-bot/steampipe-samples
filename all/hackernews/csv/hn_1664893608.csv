I got into software for the money and have mostly compartmentalized that side of my life since relationships with people are what really makes me happy.<p>Given my personality I&#x27;ve been wondering if I may be happier doing something that&#x27;s more people oriented but still makes use of the knowledge and experience that I&#x27;ve accumulated over the past decade.<p>Could I leverage my strong background in software engineering to pivot into sales? Should I look into something else that&#x27;s related and relatively social like developer relations?<p>A word of advice from anyone who has made a change like this would be a huge help.

To reactivate my account, I was supposed to upload my ID and information from my guardians (???).

I click the link, only reconfirm my name and phone number, click next, I see a page that “they are processing my request” and receive an email directly that my account was reinstated, but they deleted the tweets from before I was 13. I can still see my tweets, followers and who’s following me, but my avatar and bio are gone.<p>I now get that the problem was that I had tweets from when I was supposedly 5, but I really don’t understand why my account was disabled with the explanation that I am _now_ under 13 and why everything is now messed up? Also why there was no warning or a multi step process.<p>And why did they need my exact age in the beginning, if it’s only my input and they trust it - why didn’t they just keep the “Are you over 18?” button? Or save the input from the hundreds of times I had to click that. Oh, yes!
