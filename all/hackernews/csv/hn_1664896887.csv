Since then, a lot of people signed up for our tiny side project. Enough to say that it is well past breaking even! We tried many ideas, and ultimately settled on the simple design and the RSS output by default. It is incredible how many people still use RSS nowadays. Thanks to all of you!<p>Below is the original Show HN post from last year:<p>BARE grew out of the idea to reduce one&#x27;s Twitter timeline to bare tweets - blog-post-like writings devoid of media, links, hashtags, or any social interaction mechanics. Once you sign up with BARE, it will continuously check your Twitter timeline and only show you the long-form text-based tweets in it. Like a good old blog reader.
But why do that, you may ask? What&#x27;s the point?<p>Because, we believe that this is one of the easiest ways to discover people&#x27;s true personality, beneath the chatter and social media clickbait. It is also a naturally distraction-free method to keep oneself concentrated over the content without the urge to skim and keep scrolling down. One of the easiest ways to evoke concentration is to reduce the sources of distraction.<p>Is anybody actually writing such tweets? A lot of people. Check the tiny portion we follow here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bare.tw&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bare.tw&#x2F;</a> and discover the ones in your timeline by signing up.",story,https://bare.tw,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

33081368,Show HN: Dstack – a command-line utility to provision infra for ML workflows,2022-10-04T15:01:54Z,cheptsov,2,false,false,1,[33081571],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi. :) I’m Andrey, the creator of dstack. I started this project while I was working at JetBrains where I helped the PyCharm team to improve support for Jupyter notebooks.
As I was in close contact with many ML devs (who used PyCharm) I was able to see their struggle with running ML workflows.<p>Unlike traditional dev workflows, ML workflows are difficult to run on a local machine (due to the lack of memory, more CPUs&#x2F;GPUs, etc). This is why people often have to use remote machines (e.g. via SSH), or adopt one of the end-to-end MLOps platforms.<p>Using remote machines is not difficult but it is tedious and requires a lot of manual actions. Using MLOps platforms on the other hand automates the manual work but requires the use of an opinionated interface, which often kills developer productivity.<p>Imagine, if you could run your ML workflows the very same way as you do it locally, but they would actually run in the cloud. And you wouldn’t need to worry about provisioning infrastructure, setting up the environment, etc.<p>I’m excited to show you dstack, an open-source tool that does exactly that.<p>It’s a command-line utility that allows you to run any workflows while it provisions infrastructure, setup the environment, and copies code&#x2F;data for you. No need to install or configure anything in your environment or cloud. Simply install the CLI and run it.<p>The launch blog post: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlopsfluff.dstack.ai&#x2F;p&#x2F;simplifying-the-mlops-stack"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlopsfluff.dstack.ai&#x2F;p&#x2F;simplifying-the-mlops-stack</a><p>We’d love to hear your thoughts and ideas.
