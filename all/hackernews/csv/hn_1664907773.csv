33083893,Show HN: Cape: Serverless Confidential Computing,2022-10-04T17:42:42Z,gavinuhma,6,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Cape is a serverless platform for deploying functions to secure enclaves. Our mission is to give every developer a simple way to build secure apps that respect end-user privacy through encryption and confidential computing.<p>Cape is built on AWS Nitro Enclaves, which are isolated VMs carved out by EC2&#x27;s Nitro Hypervisor. They have no network, no storage, and no interactive access (such as a shell). So effectively, no one can see what the enclave is doing. The way Cape uses Nitro Enclaves is unique, as we add a number of security, scale, and ease of use features for developers.<p>Cape has three main features:
- `cape encrypt`: Encrypts data that can only be processed by your functions within Cape&#x27;s secure enclave.
- `cape deploy`: Deploy your encrypted functions to Cape (anything from simple scripts to machine learning pipelines).
- `cape run`: Run your functions on the encrypted data, keeping your functions and the data confidential.<p>How did we get here?
Four years ago we launched a project called TF Encrypted, which is framework for running Tensorflow on encrypted data. TFE is based on secure multi-party computation. It&#x27;s popular with cryptographers and machine learning engineers doing research on secure computation protocols applied to neural networks.<p>Our work with TFE inspired us to think about developers and the tools they have to build secure apps that can protect the confidentiality of their end-user&#x27;s data.<p>I believe that developer&#x27;s want to do right by their users, they often just don&#x27;t have the time or the resources. Security and privacy features tend to fall off of the priority list, unfortunately.<p>We hope Cape can help usher in a new era of secure, privacy-focused apps by making confidential computing accessible to the average developer.<p>I&#x27;ll leave it at that for now. Please reach out if you have any questions.<p>The open beta of Cape is currently free. You can signup and run your first function within a few minutes.",story,https://capeprivacy.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
