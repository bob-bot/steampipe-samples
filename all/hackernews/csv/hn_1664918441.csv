I make just enough money for us to not get any breaks in childcare (government or through university), but it will significantly impact our finances. Unfortunately there is no family close by due to moving for my wife’s schooling. Originally I thought trying to work mostly odd hours and on the weekend was very feasible, but now about a week into sleepless nights I am starting to have doubts.

This decision s an enormous mistake that yields suboptimal adherence to best-practice and crucially, a flawed data set that a founder may clumsily use to quantify market fit, product efficacy, customer feedback, sales channel(s) forecasts, etc.
The sales experience required to build ground-up processes, rate inbound&#x2F;outbound prospect funnels, execute competition&#x2F;price-point&#x2F;script analysis, etc. to launch new product is immense.<p>I&#x27;m ready for next 8-10 year run, need zero pay at outset and am actively searching for a brilliant engineering team that covets individual to make their vision a reality within top organizations around the world.
