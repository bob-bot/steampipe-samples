They cant possibly believe that somebody wants to join them and work with them.<p>- They&#x27;re worried you&#x27;re going take somebody&#x27;s job if they hire you, so they don&#x27;t want to hire you. They assume you are too good to not end up being the boss, and they wont hire you because trey want to protect their own jobs.<p>So what&#x27;s left if your not interested in starting your own company or getting our of tech?<p>What do you do when you legitimately just want to join a good team and build cool stuff fir the long term?<p>In short, what do developers over 40 do to stay in tech?
