I applied to a small local company that is seeking a digital transformation. The owner liked me a lot, I&#x27;m set to start in a few days.<p>How can I make sure that I crush this? I&#x27;d like to stay with the company for a few years at least, and make a career pivot to being a director. Are there other certs I can take? I think the thing I have to remember the most is to display confidence. Are there directors out there with advice for younger people? I&#x27;m even thinking of cold calling&#x2F;msging directors on linkedin to ask them for advice.<p>How would you go about it?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
