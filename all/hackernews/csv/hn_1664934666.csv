The latter lets me outcompete hedge funds. Hedge funds even have systems for people (mostly brokers&#x2F;investment banks) submit ideas to them on what to trade, and get rewarded if it&#x27;s profitable.[1] Numerai has an explicit platform for this.[2]<p>Why, then, don&#x27;t hedge funds run their own hardware &#x2F; R&amp;D labs that design and deploy sensors to get data about the world other hedge funds don&#x27;t have? Why don&#x27;t hedge funds build and launch a bunch of cheap satellites with interesting sensors that only the hedge fund has access to? Or footfall sensors in major cities? Or agricultural sensors in target geographies?<p>Taken to the extreme, why don&#x27;t hedge funds build e.g. Twitter to figure out what people are talking about and why, but then not let anyone use the API? Or why didn&#x27;t they build Google Streetview to figure out what was in the world and where?<p>In other words: why don&#x27;t we see more hedge funds trying to go get information about the world themselves instead of buying it from data vendors?<p>I guess the best answer is the return doesn&#x27;t justify the cost. Better to just buy thousands of different datasets from different data vendors instead.<p>But is there maybe a different answer where it&#x27;s just &quot;culturally, that&#x27;s not what people at hedge funds do or think about&quot;?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alpha_capture_system
