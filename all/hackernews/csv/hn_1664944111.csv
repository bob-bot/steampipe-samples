I&#x27;ve been working on Mesh, and I think it is time to it with you guys. Building on Cardano is difficult, because it lacks documentations and proper SDKs. This is where Mesh fills in this gap. With those beginner guides, is incredibly easy to get started, removing the pain of getting the simplest things to work. It is well engineered, the cloest &quot;competitor&quot; package size is over 10MB, while Mesh is less than 300KB, thus its light weight and your dApp will run fast. It is well documented and flexible, so you can build any dApp you can imagine.<p>From the way the code is written to the way it is being used; Please let me know what you think!",story,https://mesh.martify.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
