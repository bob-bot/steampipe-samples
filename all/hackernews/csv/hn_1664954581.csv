I want to solve problems using code and become good at it. I know some basic constructs but can&#x27;t put them together to solve a given problem. I know basic Python syntax.<p>I have a BSc in Chemistry from India. I came across your Twitter profile and saw the number of languages you are proficient in and then across your website the projects you have built. Sadly, I am no more in university but I want to build software and be good at it.<p>I want to gain the ability to write programs myself from vague problem definitions and eventually create beautiful things using code. I also want to be able to read code written by other people so that I can use the knowledge from them and also dig deep enough so that I can find out what is wrong with the code if there is any error.<p>Can you suggest me a learning path? If I have to learn mathematics for that, I am ready to do so.<p>Will wait for your reply.<p>Thanks
Pratyush<p>===<p>I almost fell for it. The thing that got me thinking is that I don&#x27;t have a Twitter account. I do have a github account with a few projects and a personal website.<p>Is this a scam? If so, how?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

His outrage prompted me to realize that most cybersecurity professionals and decision makers do not get the opportunity to see the evidence many of the “awards” in cybersecurity are bogus. I took a few minutes to search my email archives for some of the pay to play awards we have received in recent months.<p>WE WON WHAT?!?
In the recent entry, Triangulating a Sustainable Revolution, I explain the “why and how” of what makes WitFoo appear so weird to the cybersecurity market. Because of our mission and philosophies, we do not participate in unsustainable market behaviors that include pay-to-play awards and recognition.<p>We know for a fact that none of these institutions have tested our product or spoken to any of our employees, customers, partners, or advisors.<p>THE OFFENDERS LIST
Here is a (non-comprehensive) list of bogus awards we have won and the small price to allow re-reprints. For obvious reasons, I am not adding a hyperlink.<p>CIO Review Magazine – $3,000 for “One of the 20 Most Promising Cybersecurity Solution Providers 2020”
