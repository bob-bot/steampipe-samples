33092588,ASK HN: I encountered an online scam operation. What can I do?,2022-10-05T07:59:45Z,dazhbog,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"A family member got sent a link in this format
https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bazaraki.to-dispatch.ink&#x2F;83923676746<p>and they were asking them to do some payment verification to receive a payment. They usually target victims that are selling on Facebook, Ebay and other websites. They then craft a specific website for your item and pretend to have paid and send you a link to collect the payment. Because you are a &quot;first time user&quot; they have a specific verification page that you need to input your card details.<p>For example if you sell a piano on hackernews, they then make a website called<p><pre><code>  hackernews.3ds-order.online&#x2F;123123
</code></pre>
123123 is the unique identifier of the piano, with a correct image, and on the top left they will also put the logo of HN. To sell the fake page even more.<p>I did some reverse lookups on their webapp IP (185.106.93.21) and I got more than 40 pages with scammy names.<p>Examples:<p><pre><code>  3ds-order.online, payl.online, processing.tel, qhdns.net, rentcars.store, toptyler.com, transferz.online, deal-express.icu, dealy.ink, fast-deal.live  
</code></pre>
NS servers:<p><pre><code>  ns1.qhdns.net, ns2.qhdns.net
</code></pre>
I contacted some registrars like NameCheap, but they say I don&#x27;t have enough evidence. I have screenshots similar to this other person that also blogged about this scam [1]<p>So my question to HN is, what do we do in such cases?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;osint.fans&#x2F;gumtree-australia-post-credit-card-scam",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
