These issues get talked about as if they&#x27;re a bigger thing than what they actually are.<p>&quot;My benefactors are not impressed by your inobedience&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s writing in a way that seems like it&#x27;s not the news being reported, it&#x27;s the news seeking an anger-click by using an inflammatory title. Things appear to be only getting more sensational, more antagonistic, more like a thinly veiled attempt to convey a message of &quot;party&#x27;s over, you&#x27;ll go back to your cube or you&#x27;ll starve&quot;.<p>My hypothesis: I think new media is in a negative feedback loop. The misbehavior and editorial indiscretion we see now maybe is a result of pressure from near-instant social reporting of events and the push to regain the reader&#x27;s attention. We see more and more rushed articles with factual inaccuracies, simple typos, often the body is 1-2 sentences long, barely more expressive than the title. Headlines are also embellished to the point of being inaccurate, or rely on double-entendre to garner attention.<p>Consider this flow chart:<p>0. internet and social media reporting starts<p>1. viewership&#x2F;readership drops<p>2. post sensationalist stories to gain readers<p>3. viewership&#x2F;readership drops, mistrust created<p>4. lower the time to publish by lowering editorial standards<p>5. viewership&#x2F;readership drops, writer quality suffers<p>6. readers are gone, but a passerby&#x27;s bar is much lower, and can be attracted through positive AND negative means..<p>7. viewership&#x2F;readership drops, writers are now guest-contributors, readers are drivebys seeking only to use your article&#x27;s title to validate their own whims in online arguments<p>8. more ad spend, more &#x27;listicles&#x27; with one item per pageload, more modal dialogs, more paywall<p>9. viewership&#x2F;readership is mostly bots, scrapers, and facebook users at this point.<p>10. Speculation: This is the stage where all your readers are people who rage-clicked your stock-art thumbnail on a Taboola ad block, or the Firefox new-tab screen. You pray to be lucky enough to be the subject of a viral Reddit ragepost. You use titles and subject matter like &quot;This Mitch McConnell Dildo Is (Actually) Here for a Good Cause&quot; [0]<p>There&#x27;s a distinct feeling that we, or popular news media, have pivoted the business model to an org that is 49% ads, 50% ad tracking, and 1% content in that you still accept money from college grads to publish their &quot;opinion column&quot; ostensibly through what&#x27;s left of the brand you once had.<p>In the quest to get clicks and readers, in a world where nobody reads past the headline, where does this guide us? What is the bottom of this barrel that we&#x27;re racing to?<p>Ask yourself:<p>- When do we just give up on the story-body and just post the headline?<p>- At what point is it more profitable for news outlets to be acquired by corporations seeking to sell more goods?<p>- When does the news <i>become</i> the advertisement?<p>[o] - This Mitch McConnell Dildo Is (Actually) Here for a Good Cause - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;jgpvyx&#x2F;mitch-mcconnell-dame-dildo -",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
