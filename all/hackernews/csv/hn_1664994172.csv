Most of the work in this space is short form video for YouTube &#x2F; Instagram and TV.<p>Now I am seeing the video generating AI (imagen video from Google on the front page) and I’m 100% sure a good percentage of the work will vanish. There’s loads of work that ad agencies will just hire an AI prompt guy to generate for ads. Big companies will still make ads, of course, but smaller gigs that keep the whole industry afloat? What about even 10 million $ shots with CG characters that will now become commonplace?<p>I’ve retrained before. I started off as an editor, then did VR video, now moved into CG. I’m pretty good at my job - I’ve worked on stuff for Dell and Apple, including stuff you’ve probably seen.<p>It’s funny to think I might have to retrain yet again. I didn’t expect image generation AI to be the next big leap. I was already moving into more storytelling content (ie documentaries) because that’s more defensible against AI. But I expected 3-4 years before video generation would just come out.<p>Now it seems like it’s happening so quickly I’m not sure they won’t have good stuff out in 6 months to a year.<p>So - HN - what do I do now? And what about the other fellas in my industry who will be out of a job? In my estimate, we are talking about tens of thousands.<p>To counter the obvious: I have learnt web dev at one point I thought I’d make the jump, even started learning React but I found the work to be mind numbing. I just love making images. But I feel like Pierre Auguste Renoir’s who was a plate painter in France and did a good living out of it - until the process was industrialised and he struggled (maybe for the rest of his life?

33098970,Show HN: Earn 9.62% on US Treasury I Bonds on Yotta,2022-10-05T17:58:45Z,adammoelis,9,false,false,8,"[33099039,33099012,33098980,33099052]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey all<p>My name is Adam, and I’m a co-founder at Yotta (YC S20), an app that uses behavioral psychology to help people save money by making saving exciting.<p>We built a feature on Yotta where you can earn 9.62% APY via US Treasury I Bonds. (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.withyotta.com&#x2F;i-bonds)<p>This is an absurd yield for a security that is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government - the strongest guarantee you can get. For comparison, most high-yield savings accounts with FDIC coverage are paying ~2%.<p>The backstory:<p>I Bonds were established by the US Treasury in 1998 to provide returns linked to inflation to protect consumer purchasing power. The rate on I Bonds is determined from the last six months of CPI data and is adjusted twice per year. Inflation is typically around 2% per year, so I Bonds have never been relevant since the rate was never that attractive.<p>Inflation spiked in 2022 driving I Bonds reached a record high yield of 9.62% APY. If you buy them by October 31st, you lock in this rate for six months from the purchase date. In the last 12 months, around $27B has been deposited as a result of the insanely high yield. This compares to $348m in 2020. Note that you have to hold I Bonds for at least a year and you forgo 3 the last three months of earned interest if you redeem before five years. You can deposit a max of $10k into I Bonds per calendar year.<p>So if you can get 9.62% APY on a government backed security when savings accounts are yielding 2%, why doesn’t everyone have I Bonds?<p>A few reasons.<p>1. Most people have never heard of them.<p>2. People don’t want to tie up cash for a year in a CD-like product.<p>3. The only way to buy I Bonds has been on the world’s worst website, Treasury Direct. You have to fill out long forms, click on a virtual keyboard to type your password, can’t use the back button, and make one mistake and you get locked out of your account. The whole thing is a colossal pain in the ass.<p>To solve 1) and 3), we wrapped an easy-to-use UI to buy I Bonds within Yotta. Users opt into Yotta creating a Treasury Direct account on their behalf, and we automate the painful part - interacting with Treasury Direct on the backend. This enables us to provide a great customer experience, making it easy for people to get the 9.62%. If anyone wants to control their Treasury Direct directly without Yotta, they can request it, and we will transfer over their account to no longer be managed by Yotta.<p>Hope you guys check it out and can take advantage of the 9.62% rate before 10&#x2F;31! Note that if you already have a Treasury Direct account, we are unable to support you for I Bonds unfortunately.<p>Happy to answer any questions and looking forward to any feedback.<p>P.S.
