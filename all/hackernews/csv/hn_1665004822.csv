33101008,Show HN: Speed of all of your processes across entire stack in one dashboard,2022-10-05T20:40:23Z,sshussain270,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I built Checkpoints App out of my experience of not being able to quickly and easily measure the speed of processes across my tech stack in my startup.<p>All startups optimize for speed in all of their operations: deploying code, responding to API requests, loading the UI,  and in background processes such as sending emails to users or processing data in an ETL pipeline. But the tools available to measure the performance of all these operations are separate and time-costly to integrate, in the first place.<p>Checkpoints App allows you to measure the speed of processes across your entire stack with minimal overhead and collects that data into a single dashboard. Integrating it into your tech stack is as easy as dropping a `print()` statement in your code, while you&#x27;re writing it.<p>It comes with client-side Python, JS and Bash scripts. You drop checkpoint statements anywhere in the code, defining a process name and checkpoint name, for example:  `.&#x2F;checkpoints.sh process1 checkpoint1` where process1 is your process name and checkpoint1 is your checkpoint name.<p>Once you&#x27;ve dropped checkpoints in your code. It will automatically create the process pipelines in your dashboard along with the speed metrics i.e, how long does it take, on average, to go from checkpoint1 to checkpoint2 . Then you can start optimizing for speed.<p>Another major problem I saw was that most lightweight tools out there let you measure performance in a single part of your stack, for example, you need to use Lighthouse in the front-end UI and CloudWatch for your backend API endpoints. With Checkpoints App, however, you can create tailored processes across your tech stack. For example, you can add the first checkpoint in your backend and the second checkpoint in your front end.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback. If you&#x27;d like to try this out, signup at the landing page and I&#x27;ll send you the access.",story,https://checkpoints-app-36545.web.app,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
