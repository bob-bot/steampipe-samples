33102736,Tools for building a subscription/SaaS product,2022-10-05T23:58:32Z,thercyl,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi,<p>I built a website on Replit, and would now like to monetize it with subscription. I would like some advice on the best tools for that. Specifically, what I&#x27;m looking for is something that:<p>1. supports multiple tiers of offerings eg free users will get limited views, tier 1 users will get x features, tier 2 users will get x+y features and so forth
2.  allows users to sign in (using email, gmail, etc) so that they can manage their subscription and so that they can access the premium features
3. take payments
4. a professional looking landing site like this https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uideck.com&#x2F;templates&#x2F;play-html&#x2F;<p>I looked at multiple solutions:<p>1. Chargebee (but requires an official work email account that I don&#x27;t yet have. it&#x27;s also unclear if it offers a sign in feature)
2. Stripe subscription + customer portal (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;api&#x2F;subscriptions and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;customer-management&#x2F;get-started)
3. Squarespace and Wix (but saas apps don&#x27;t seem to be their primary use case)
4. buy a bootstrap framework 
5. Memberful<p>The ideal solution would have the following (in order of priority):<p>1. have all of the features above so that I would need to use only one tool and not multiple
2. easy to integrate &#x2F; as little code as possible
3. Cheap if not free
4. gives me the flexibility to a&#x2F;b test the monetization&#x2F;subscription models eg being able to test when to surface the paywall, pricing, etc<p>Would anyone be able to advice? Thanks in advance.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
