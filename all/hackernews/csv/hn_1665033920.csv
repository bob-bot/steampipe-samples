I should note that I live in an Eastern European country that borders Russia. I do not speak Russian, and the only Russian YouTube channel I watch is the English version of Garage 54. My IP correctly identifies my country.<p>A few months ago I created a new Google account as my primary account was a Google Workspace account and I wanted to create a YouTube Premium Family, which you can&#x27;t do with Workspace. I found some tools to copy my subscriptions over, and once I&#x27;d done that the new YouTube feed looked basically the same as the old account, just with a few repeated videos I&#x27;d seen as it didn&#x27;t copy watched videos over. I disabled YouTube on the Workspace account so I made sure to use the right one. Since then everything has been great until this week.<p>Over the last few days my feed has started to have a bunch of Russian propoganda channels filling it. Usually the first five to ten videos are my subscriptions, then after that it&#x27;s around 50% subscriptions and related and 50% random. The problem is the random videos are heavily weighted towards Russian propoganda, it&#x27;s not the same as you see on the front page if you are logged out.<p>My YouTube watch history doesn&#x27;t show anything unusual and I haven&#x27;t logged into any devices that others have access to. Nobody in my home or Family watches Russian propoganda, and I don&#x27;t think anyone at my office would. Whenever I see these videos I select &#x27;Don&#x27;t recommend channel&#x27; or &#x27;Not interested&#x27;, but YouTube is still recommending the same type of videos.<p>Any suggestions?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
