Even stranger is the link starts with &quot;paypa.cn&#x2F;withdraw&quot;. This does not appear to be a site owned by PayPal.<p>A quick search shows a PayPal community forums post (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paypal-community.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;Managing-Account&#x2F;What-does-quot-Get-more-details-in-your-Paypal-China-account&#x2F;td-p&#x2F;2989268), where users that have contacted support are being told that it&#x27;s a &quot;known issue&quot;. Based on the post date this has been there for at least six days.<p>I&#x27;m a bit skeptical though. A bug causing the link to show up when it shouldn&#x27;t, as well as someone forgetting the L in paypal.cn both sounds like things that could happen, but simultaneously? Even then, it seems like they could have fixed this days ago, and should have as potentially sending users and their transaction IDs to a different website seems like a pretty big security issue.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
