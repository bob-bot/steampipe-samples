I’m Zach, from Coherence (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.withcoherence.com&#x2F;). We’re building software that provides an integrated way to write, preview, and deploy code from one simple configuration. Check out our explainer video here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V2YHVx8QsLg and a high level demo  here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;072c2afd1099496298f69ab21fdf2820<p>We started Coherence because we found technology teams spent 30-40% of their time yak shaving and writing glue code, instead of building products our customers love. We don’t think every team should have to build their own internal development platform, so we’re building the software we’d want to buy. Following the example of other great products like Replit, our toolkit is based on integration across the stages of an app’s lifecycle - from dev to production.<p>Coherence provides one integrated dashboard with cloud development environments, automatic CI&#x2F;CD, and full-stack environments for each branch (as well as production), all with one simple configuration. A developer can write, test, review, and deploy code from one interface with best practices built in. Devs are intuitively navigated to their own cloud resources when needed, eliminating time spent searching consoles for every log, metric, or configuration setting you might need. We currently support containerized full-stack web apps on AWS and Google Cloud. Unlike the PaaS category defined by Heroku, our goal is to help teams leverage the platforms provided by the best cloud providers, keeping the benefits of running in your own cloud account: unlimited extensibility, cost savings, compliance with audit requirements, and freedom to easily exit our platform without an impact to your systems.<p>You can play around with a Coherence sandbox and get a taste of the developer experience at app.withcoherence.com&#x2F;sandbox. If you like what you can see, you can also deploy an app into your AWS or GCP with one of our starter templates for a new project: app.withcoherence.com. We’re happy to support onboarding on a call or via Slack and we’d love to discuss what it would look like to migrate one of your existing apps to Coherence. We’re excited to get your feedback, so please feel free to drop us a note at hn@withcoherence.com",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Trying to login to my account, it turns out that the official website ionos.com is unusably slow (like it takes 10 minutes for each page to load, and it doesn&#x27;t load correctly). So I couldn&#x27;t even contact support.<p>Checking their official status page and Twitter accounts, I couldn&#x27;t find any mention of the incident.<p>After more than 2 hours, I was able to reach their customer support via phone call, and they informed me that they are having technical issues, and service will return shortly, which it did.<p>So my issue isn&#x27;t that the outage happened.

I could also set up my own DNS server and make all my machines use it. Needless to say, that&#x27;s way more hassle than just making everything public and buying a domain.<p>Another way to keep it private is to issue a wildcard certificate through Let&#x27;s Encrypt and point my DNS records to a reverse proxy which would use the certificate. This would require all network traffic to pass through the proxy, making it a single point of failure.<p>Have you encountered this problem before?
