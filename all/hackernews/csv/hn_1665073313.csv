So I am studying at university and we have this advance AI class in our first master semester and we have to build a chatbot that can answer questions about movies. I never did such a thing before, although I am a capable web developer (3years exp) 
Where and how do I get started?<p>I thought about three AI&#x27;s
1. Intent matching
2. gathering the data
3. answering the question<p>An API to receive&#x2F;send messages is already provided. Further data sets that need to be used to answer questions are provided. These include: knowledge graph and several external resources, including a multi-media dataset, pre-trained embeddings, and a crowdsourcing dataset.<p>In the lecture we learned about SPARQL a query language to query knowledge graphs. Is this of any use? I cannot think of how I would create these queries dynamically based on a user input sentence...<p>In the end the bot has to be able to answer:<p>1. factual questions: such as &quot;Who directed bullet train?&quot; (based on knowledge graph)
2. embedding question: &quot;What is the genre of movie x&quot; (based on embedding)
3. Multimedia questions: &quot;show me the picture of leonardo di caprio&quot; (based on multi-media dataset)
4. Recommendation questions: &quot;recommend me a similar movie to james bond&quot; (based on knowledge graph)
5. Crowdsourcing questions: &quot;what is the publication date of jurassic park&quot; (based on crowdsourcing dataset)<p>Important: We just need to use these datasets to answer the questions, but can use any other available technology such as various libraries or huggingface etc.<p>How would you go about this task? How can I plug in a natural language question into a knowledge graph an get answers?<p>TL:DR I need to build a chatbot for uni based on given datasets such as knowledge graph, multimedia dataset, pretrained embeddings etc. How do I start?<p>Thank you very much",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
