I&#x27;m a pretty Jr. developer with about 1YOE all things considered. Im entirely self-taught. I did a few months at an agency mainly writing JS and Python, I did a few months of contract work writing Elixir, and I&#x27;ve been in my current position for about 6 months, mainly writing TS.<p>I left the agency due to getting a better offer (my current job) and chose not to renew my contract at the Elixir shop for the same reason, I didn&#x27;t want to overstretch and decided to focus fully on my new role. I&#x27;ve never been reprimanded or spoken to about my performance in any of these roles.<p>At the agency, the code I wrote was typically standalone. Small client apps in React or simple Python servers. Small, one-off tasks that didn&#x27;t need to be maintained or integrate with any existing systems. This is where I feel I shine.<p>My current role, however, is the complete opposite. Our product is massive, and spread out over dozens of repositories and interconnected dependencies. The client, a <i>gargantuan</i> react app, in particular, has been a struggle for me to understand and be productive in. This has been a theme in my personal projects as well. I can write a simple react app and a server for it to talk to. Perform basic CRUD ops and the like, etc. But as soon as I wanted to do anything more complex or integrate with external dependencies I would begin to get bogged down.<p>I&#x27;m beginning to feel like I&#x27;m just fundamentally incapable of fully grasping and working within large interconnected systems. And the unfortunate reality is that <i>most</i> dev jobs I&#x27;m aware of necessitate it.<p>I know &quot;imposters syndrome&quot; gets thrown around a lot for developers who feel like they have no clue what they&#x27;re doing, but are actually quite talented. I&#x27;d love to apply that label to my current situation, but I just don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;d be accurate. I know that I can do some things really well. I know that, in some ways at least, I&#x27;m an excellent developer. I just feel that in one of the most important and fundamental ways (understanding complex systems), I&#x27;m very much lacking.<p>Any input or advice would be welcomed and appreciated.
