So some kind of app that does that on global scale for the Church<p>- Would you do it for a dollar? - I even coded this. Basically person can ask someone else: would you _____ for a dollar?

This might not be possible because of the logo, copyrights and shit<p>- Messaging with push notifications only - nowadays you can reply directly from push notifications. So no chat lists, no list of messages or such. You reply directly via push notification<p>- Don&#x27;t meet in person - some kind of dating site that forces you not to meet in person, so everything must stay online<p>- Stupid people repellent - like some kind of mace or such, if someone annoys you, you spray them or around to repel them<p>- Alien emoji - regular emojis but with double eyes and green color, like this ::D ::) ;;) They are more strong than regular, so if you type ::D it means you are extra happy<p>- Social network where everything is fake - fake followers, fake likes. Like a hyper networks, you become popular extra fast and gain followers fast.
