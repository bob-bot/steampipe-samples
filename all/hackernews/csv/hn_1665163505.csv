We&#x27;ve created a product that allows users to understand the costs and tax implications of intelligently managing their equity compensation.<p>We&#x27;ve also partnered with top CPAs and tax lawyers allowing users to meet with a personal advisor and create a customized wellness plan to manage equity, tax documentation, submit taxes at year end, and plan for retirement through tax advantages. What are tax advantages? Many employees utilize their 401k, but are unaware of additional options like Roth IRAs, backdoor IRAs, and HSAs. The average employee is able to save $1,200,000 throughout their career in tax savings by utilizing tax-advantaged accounts when compared to investing the same money directly in the S&amp;P 500.<p>Avoiding a compounding income tax has substantial benefits long term. Our platform provides optimized recommendations from your advisor and allows you to create retirement accounts and automate retirement contributions in tax-advantaged accounts tailored specifically to your financial goals. You can also track your investment progress and tax savings in real-time, all within your account.<p>Our tools are free to use, and our algorithm connects you to a personal advisor upon account creation.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts and feedback, and you can check us out at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.compdesk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.compdesk.com</a> to get started.<p>Cheers -- Landon and Khalil",story,https://www.compdesk.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I was going to upgrade them to Yahoo Plus email so that if there were any problems accessing the account we could get support to fix it.  However, I learned that it is still an active AT&amp;T account with email hosted by Yahoo. I can log into att.com but there are no services or products associated with the email and no billing.<p>Years ago I had a number of clients that lost their sbcglobal.net email in similar situations where the email was not converted to the free Yahoo email after closing their ATT&#x2F;SBC account leaving them in limbo. The gist of it is that if the account ever got hacked or the password needed to be reset then AT&amp;T won&#x27;t help because there is no product or service associated with the account and Yahoo can&#x27;t help because it is still an AT&amp;T account in their records.<p>Does anyone have any experience or advice with this or someone I can talk to?
