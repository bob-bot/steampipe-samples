That means the money you worked for and saved buys less and less. And if you’re in the developing world like me, your money doesn’t just get hit by inflation. It gets slammed. Destroyed. Completely wiped out.<p>Hello from Cuba! My name is Camilo, and I’m the founder of XFXHub.com, a community of fintech entrepreneurs united by a common vision– to help our friends and families beat inflation– and a common coin: $XFX.<p>Many families living in countries with high inflation receive dollars or euros from family members who have left to work abroad in the U.S or the EU. These remittance payments of hard currency make it easier to live in countries whose currencies lose value rapidly against those less inflationary currencies. In Cuba many families depend on remittances from friends and family in the U.S.<p>In Cuba and in many Latam countries, as well as Africa and Asia, including India, local banks and money transfer companies apply terrible exchange rates and fees that result in families receiving much less money from the remittances they are sent.<p>The XFX community is solving this problem with peer-to-peer remittance. We’ve developed a simple fintech template that makes it easy for anyone to help friends and family convert USD, EUR, BTC or any other currency to local money at free market exchange rates and with low fees.<p>We have hundreds of independent P2P remittance providers in our community and we’re collaborating to take XFX to the next level with discovery tools for free market rates of any currency and more.<p>Visit XFXhub.com to learn more. Join our Coin Community at XFX.slyk.io. Earn XFX by helping us grow.

I hope and try to convey the message clearly without appearing rude.<p>This is not my first job as Software Engineer. I currently work as a solo Software Engineer for company, developing internal apps. This is a company which provide Network and Security services, so not primarily software.  I&#x27;m not a freelance, so I&#x27;m their employee. I work for them part-time (60%). But the things I&#x27;m concerned about don&#x27;t apply only for this situation, it has happened to me as a freelance too. The following could just be my impressions. So, I&#x27;m happy to be corrected if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>I&#x27;m worried that the Software Engineer role is getting abused in so many ways. What I mean by abused? The expectation people have that I have to do things not related to my job as Software Engineer. The current company I work expect me to (ordered, according to me, form the most unrelated task to the most related for a Software Engineer)<p>1. Design UI<p>2. Design UX and interaction design<p>4. DevOps from production, development and testing.<p>5. Project management for the software I write. From gathering requirements, give priority, estimation, deadline, sprints, gather user-feedback, schedule meeting...<p>6. Training for the software I write.<p>7. Customer support, help-desk, 100% of the time on call support for the software I write.<p>8. Write User Manuals, Administrator Manual.<p>9. Write Technical Manual<p>10. Design, Develop and Test the actual code, database...<p>Sometime I feel like my role would be just 9 and 10, maybe 8 also. I&#x27;m burned out. I feel people doesn&#x27;t appreciate what I&#x27;m doing. Just today the CEO of the company messaged me in slack &quot;Does&#x27;t work shit&quot; because the browser was somehow unresponsive. He didn&#x27;t give me the time to look at the logs and see what was causing the hang-up. I don&#x27;t know what to do honestly.  One of the reason I choose SE because I don&#x27;t like dealing with people. They don&#x27;t know what they want from the software they want me to build for them, and I don&#x27;t want to think for them (sorry if this appear insensitive). And I honestly don&#x27;t want to participate in that kind of decision making roles. The company is not toxic or bad, but I feel like they don&#x27;t truly understand how software development happens. There isn&#x27;t a clear process from issue tracking to finished product.<p>Maybe SE is not a career I like, even though I spend my free time reading and learning new things about SE.<p>I hope to get some feedback from HN, because I don&#x27;t know where else to discuss about it.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
