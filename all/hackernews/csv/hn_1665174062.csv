In the spirit of &quot;thinking like the bronze medalist, not the silver medalist&quot;[1], I thought the flip-side of that question could reveal similarly interesting anecdotes.<p>I&#x27;ll start- the biggest bullet I ever dodged was when I decided not to go to business school.  At the time I was living and teaching English in Shanghai, China, and I had originally moved there because I thought that learning Chinese would look great on my grad school application.<p>After awhile, however, I realized that the best-case scenario of holding an MBA was that I&#x27;d go to work for a big-name company and become a middle manager who wears a suit and commutes to work everyday.  That sounded like a slow death to me, so I coasted in a job I disliked for a few more years until a friend told me about coding bootcamps.  I applied, was accepted, and attended a bootcamp based in Chicago, and today I&#x27;m a senior software engineer who loves the creativity inherent in the craft of coding.<p>I saved myself $100-200k in grad school tuition and 2 years of sitting through multi-hour lectures that I knew I&#x27;d hate, as well as a career trajectory that would have added little if any value to my life or the lives of others.<p>1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sive.rs&#x2F;bronze",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
