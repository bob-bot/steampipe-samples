I&#x27;ll use the results for a product I&#x27;m building and credit HN.<p>In any bootstrapped startup, web3 community, DAO etc the initial founders wear the early risk. The founders’ experiments may fail and their work may be worthless up until the product gains traction. Over time the community gets behind the mission and ultimately the product “meets the market” and garners paying customers. At this point the risk is 1:1 meaning effort is directly remunerated.<p>A startup evolves through phases of risk (from A “high” to E “low”) as a product progresses from Idea to Market.  Phase Outcome &amp; Examples of Activities:<p>A = Minimum Viable Product (ideation, building, iterations)
B = Product Beta (gathering early customer feedback, iterations)  
C = Market Ready (creating promotional materials, raising capital) 
D = Active Community Established (growth and engagement campaigns) 
E = Paying Customers<p>QUESTION:<p>What is the risk factor of the contribution made at each phase?
E.g.: 
If you think A is 100x 
Then A = 100.<p>YOUR ANSWER:<p>A = ?x
B = ?x
C = ?x
D = ?x
E = 1x<p>Share your opinion on the [?]x values and rationale if you like.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
