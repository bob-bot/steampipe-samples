33129547,Tell HN: I possibly found a great way to improve your pronunciation,2022-10-08T03:29:51Z,lifeplusplus,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Learning pronunciation is a balance between listening and speaking&#x2F;practice. This eliminates that compromise.<p>Get an audio interface and xlr mic.<p>The interface has a &quot;display&quot; function.<p>It basically lets you hear back what you&#x27;re saying&#x2F;playing. I know windows have &quot;listen to device&quot; option but it&#x27;s very delayed in comparison.<p>The lag in audio interface from speaking to listening is much much smaller.<p>I found that hearing your voice back I could hear things that I know I said wrong, but replay isn&#x27;t so soon that it gets mixed and becomes indistinguishable form my own inside voice, and not so delayed that the brain doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s my voice. It&#x27;s perfect timing.<p>Then if you go to a website that lets you see text and video at the same time, you can practice speaking along them and you will hear your voice very slightly delayed and pick up on errors. ex https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youglish.com&#x2F;<p>You see text, you start reading along them, and you hear how YOU spoke it vs how they spoke it all in like &lt;100ms, when the correct sound is completely fresh in your head.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
