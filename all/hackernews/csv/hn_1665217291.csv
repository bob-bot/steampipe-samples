33130489,Ask HN: Is Django a good choice as a framework for starting up in 2022,2022-10-08T07:24:09Z,ptrenko,1,false,false,1,[33130591],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi,
I&#x27;m looking to build my startup currently as a solo founder and am stuck on deciding which language&#x2F;platform to build with.<p>I have about 5-6 years of experience with Flask websites and a few months of experience in Django. 
Django does make a lot of the boilerplate stuff easy, but there&#x27;s a learning curve with FormView, ListView etc. However the code is cleaner since I don&#x27;t need to have dozens of endpoints.<p>I&#x27;ve also considered learning React and have built a small prototype but my productivity is way lower since I&#x27;m still learning the nuances.<p>Has anyone here had experience maintaining Django long term? How has it worked out for you?
Is it very expensive from a server&#x2F;hosting perspective? 
Is it hard to maintain later?
Will I regret choosing Django later?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
