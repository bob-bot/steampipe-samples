I&#x27;ve been working on Reflame since I quit my job at Brex last year, excited to finally open it up for everybody to try out! Here&#x27;s a demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xZ4KyfGbUFA"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=xZ4KyfGbUFA</a><p>Reflame deploys client-rendered React web apps instantly, to previews and to production.<p>In concrete wall-clock terms, deploys generally take:<p>- ~50-500ms from our VSCode extension<p>- ~500-3000ms from our GitHub app<p>(Jump to this comment (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33134082"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33134082</a>) for what makes Reflame so fast)<p>The Reflame GitHub App automatically deploys default branches to production, and other branches to previews. If you&#x27;ve used Netlify&#x2F;Vercel&#x27;s GitHub apps, you should feel right at home. The difference is it’s multiple orders of magnitudes faster. Fast enough that _you&#x27;ll probably never see an in-progress deploy on GitHub ever again_, only ready-to-go preview&#x2F;production links.<p>No more having to babysit builds or having to context switch to and from other tasks before being able to see our changes deployed in previews or production. Previewing, sharing, and even shipping, can now become part of the so-called inner loop, giving us the superpower to stay in flow state for much longer.<p>The Reflame VSCode extension is yet another order of magnitude faster than even the GitHub App. It was designed to offer an experience that can rival local development workflows in both speed and ergonomics, while addressing many of local dev&#x27;s limitations around collaboration and production-parity. Every time we make a change (e.g. by saving a file), the extension will deploy that change (in ~50-500ms) to a &quot;Live Preview&quot;, and will immediately update the app in our browsers to reflect that change.<p>Live Previews can operate in one of two modes:<p>- Development mode delivers updates through React Fast Refresh, offering the familiar state-preserving instant feedback loop we know and love from local development workflows.<p>- Production mode delivers updates by triggering a full browser reload on every change, and in exchange for this extra bit of friction, we get to develop against a byte-identical version of the fully optimized production deployment that customers will see once we ship, with a tighter feedback loop than was ever possible before.<p>Live Previews deliver updates over the internet, meaning we can effortlessly test out our changes on multiple devices simultaneously, and show our changes to anyone in the world, just by sharing a Live Preview link, all while having our updates reflected automatically across all connected devices in real-time (with live reload or React Fast Refresh _over the internet_).<p>Being able to ship quickly is valuable on its own, but Reflame&#x27;s true north star has always been to enable customers to ship quickly _with confidence_.<p>One way Reflame helps customers ship with more confidence today is by making previews with full production-parity available at every step of the development process. Previews in Reflame are accessible at the exact same URL customers will use to access the production deployment, instead of at a different subdomain for each preview (i.e. every preview is accessed through <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reflame.app"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reflame.app</a> instead of at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;some-branch-of-reflamedotapp.reflame-previews.dev"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;some-branch-of-reflamedotapp.reflame-previews.dev</a>). Behind the scenes, this is implemented using session cookies that our CDN will check to determine which version of the app to serve.<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg. We have some really exciting prototypes around testing and typechecking that we&#x27;ve been exploring that could allow us to ship with even more confidence _without ever slowing us down_.<p>If any of this sounds interesting for the apps you&#x27;re building or planning to build (taking into account this comment (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33134092"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33134092</a>) below describing what Reflame is not well suited for), please sign up and give it a try!<p>I can&#x27;t wait to see what you’ll build with it! :)",story,https://reflame.app/?source=show-hn-launch,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Our civilization is getting close to the point where this is technically feasible.
To reach this milestone as soon as possible, we introduce here the Basic Post-scarcity Map project, an effort to map the current technological state of the art and to understand how far we are from a basic post-scarcity society. We are currently in alpha stage, and we are releasing early to gather feedback and collaborators.<p>This project is an attempt to provide unbiased answers to the following questions:<p>- What technological advancements are needed to reach basic post-scarcity?<p>- What is the state of the art, what resources are available to learn about it and who is currently working on improving it?<p>- How far are we from achieving basic post-scarcity and what are the bottlenecks?<p>To accomplish this, the basic idea is to build two maps: the first where we will deconstruct the basic needs needed to reach basic post-scarcity and the technical milestones needed to satisfy them with minimal human work at the minimum cost. The second in which we input and update the state of the art for each of the technical milestones.<p>References to the current state of the art and the resources needed to learn more about it are collected in separate pages forming a shared library.<p>This is an open source and collaborative project. All contributions are fact-based, with no projections, opinions, marketing or propaganda.<p>We believe that having a searchable and living assessment of the state of the art will enable people who want to work towards this goal to know what is needed, what is currently feasible and who is currently working on what.<p>We are aware of the many limitations of this approach and in particular we know that technical bottlenecks are not the only roadblocks to a basic post-scarcity civilization. However, we also think that it is not unreasonable to assume that reducing the cost and the manpower associated with fulfilling basic needs will make it easier for public and &#x2F; or private actors to provide them as widely as possible.<p>Our goal is to make this project simple to contribute and update. At this stage we need help creating technical milestones. Domain experts are particularly welcome to shine light on the state of the art for the relevant milestones in their respective fields. Additionally, anyone with reference materials and &#x2F; or knowledge of people currently involved in solving these problems can contribute by sharing their resources in the library.<p>The project is currently live at: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postscarcitymap.org&#x2F;<p>You can make contributions directly to the library by editing the pages on our Gitlab repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;postscarcity&#x2F;library&#x2F;.<p>At the moment the process of updating the tree is still pretty manual, but we plan to automate it more.<p>If you want to join us as part of the team and contribute regularly, we also have a Discord server: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.com&#x2F;invite&#x2F;vhc8EZkmEv<p>We welcome feedback and contributions of any size.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
