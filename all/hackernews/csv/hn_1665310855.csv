So one line in the image has to be made from multiple lines plotted.<p>The plotter can not lift the pen. It plots the whole image in one long line.

I was a contractor when I moved to the UK to work for the current company.<p>Might be too specific to my case, but maybe someone out there has gone through something similar in the past&#x2F;recently?<p>About me: from EU, early 40s, 2 kids and wife, over 15 years experience as full stack dev, based in the UK working for the same company for 7+ years in a stable full stack role remotely since the pandemic as the company sole dev&#x2F;sysadmin, earning £60k+ ($66k) per year.<p>About the company: small&#x2F;medium(?) size company (13 employees + 1 owner&#x2F;director, ~£15m ($16m) turnover per year), 12+ years trading, I report to the director.<p>I feel stuck and bored as there is no progress to be made due to it being a private owned business with one director. A lot of decisions taken benefit the director personally instead of the company as a whole.<p>I want more time to get back in education, but working 9-5&#x2F;Mon-Fri is really draining and when I finish work I just want to get some rest. I have 3 months emergency fund that could pay for the house expenses if I decide to leave.<p>There are no benefits except what&#x27;s required by law (28 holidays, including bank holidays, 3% pension match), no education budget, no perks.<p>Perhaps I need to look for a bigger company with a better career path?
Maybe get back to contracting?<p>Thanks",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
