Hi,
Here&#x27;s what happens, I owned several workshops basically in garment processing, not big in scale. We do have machines but still depend on workers to some extent. So far everything is fine, I&#x27;m just considering the developing trend of industry as large and completely automatic factories are capturing the market.
I wonder if you guys know is there any necessity for me to launch a digital transformation. If there is, then what exactly should I do or is there some stuff which enables me to connect all the machines so I can easily monitor and operate them? Also, it&#x27;d better not cost me a lot.
Thanks for all your advice!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
