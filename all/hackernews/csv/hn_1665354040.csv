Some offered to invest between 3-4 million for a seed round if I could prove we can build an &quot;airbnb killer.&quot;<p>The MVP is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nomad-pass.herokuapp.com<p>Before this I just had a seed deck: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drive.google.com&#x2F;file&#x2F;d&#x2F;10OS9xmQws4wienCWpGdnf8bU1l74zFa5<p>Mind you these were investors from top tier VC firms, who were recommended to me, nearly all of them are on a &quot;Midas List&quot; and after seeing they were essentially lying to me, I knew I had been deceived. It is discouraging since we managed to get the MVP online in less than a week.<p>Most of them complimented the speed, efficiency, the beautiful seed deck presentation, and loved the concept and differentiator.<p>But most of them wanted to offer me less, coming down to 2-2.5m for the seed round versus what we had previously established as a base at 3-4 million.<p>I am asking for help from any founders here who could help put me in touch with the right investors, trustworthy, kind and caring, who can help me continue to build Nomad.<p>The concept behind Nomad is for guests and hosts to pay zero in fees, no cleaning fee, no surprise checkout fees, and all listings require self check in, along with a points rating system of 4.5-5.0 for hosts like Uber.<p>I think many of us are tired of airbnb&#x27;s exorbitant fees among other complaints.<p>The biggest difference is that Nomad can allow landlords and tenants to pay&#x2F;receive rent through the app, without credit checks, income requirements or lease agreements, so long as both agree.<p>Please am asking for help from any founders who can help or investors who want to help as well.<p>The MVP allows users to register, view, book, and search for listings by location.<p>It uses Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database on the back-end, and React.js and Redux on the front-end.<p>Thank you from my heart to all who can help, it has been a difficult time having built an MVP through alot of sheer hard work only to be lied to by investors :(",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
