33146864,Show HN: RJU – Browser extension for hackable Reddit theming,2022-10-10T01:19:19Z,dandrew5,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN! Wanted to share my weekend project Reddit JSON UI. It&#x27;s a browser extension for hackers that want to create their own theme for Reddit pages.<p>It allows total customization through use of HTML templates and CSS. It&#x27;s not yet on any extension stores as there is still much to be done but was interested in getting early feedback before submitting. It supports Manifest versions 2 and 3 which means it is both Firefox and Chrome compatible. The code is open source on GitHub and would likely serve as a good starting point for anyone else wanting to build a complex cross-browser extension. There&#x27;s also a type system that converts Reddit JSON to TypeScript that is still very early stage but again, perhaps useful to someone else working in a similar area.<p>If you&#x27;d like to check it out, there are local installation instructions in the README as well as a starting theme for HackerNews in the templates directory. I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions or issues, feel free to open a ticket in GitHub.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re interested in contributing, please reach out in GitHub. Cheers!",story,https://github.com/dan-lovelace/reddit-json-ui,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
