After a few years of off-and-on work on it, I&#x27;m pleased to release my canvas_ity library as open source.<p>TLDR: This is a single-header C++ library with no dependencies beyond the standard C++ library.  In about 2300 lines of 78-column code (not counting blanks or comments), or 1300 semicolons, it implements an API based on the basic W3C &lt;canvas&gt; specification to draw 2D vector graphics into an image buffer:<p>- Strokes and fills (with antialiasing and gamma-correct blending)<p>- Linear and radial gradients<p>- Patterns (with repeat modes and bi-cubic resampling)<p>- Line caps and line joins (handling high curvature)<p>- Dash patterns and dash offsets<p>- Transforms<p>- Lines, quadratic and cubic Beziers, arcs, rectangles<p>- Text (very basic, but does its own TTF font file parsing)<p>- Raster images (i.e., sprites)<p>- Clipping (via masking)<p>- Compositing modes (Porter-Duff)<p>- Drop shadows with Gaussian blurs<p>Why?  Some years ago I needed to programmatically draw on an image file.  I looked at Skia and was put off by its size and build complexity.  Cairo was much better, but by then I was spoiled by the STB single-header libraries.  I like tiny code and writing a single-header but powerful vector graphics library seemed like a fun challenge and good way to pay things forward.  I ended up with something that can compile down to less than 36 KiB of object code on x86-64 and uncovered a lot of interesting browser &lt;canvas&gt; quirks along the way with my testing suite.
