booking.com rescinded my signed contract one day before my flight to Amsterdam and 5 days before my start date. It happened on September 9, 2022. Same scenario happened to other people from my country, Iran.<p>booking.com didn&#x27;t even respond to any of my emails after that. They mentioned that the withdrawal of the offer is because of some “changes in business requirements” which was a ridiculous reason 5 days before my start date. The actual reason is booking.com doesn’t want to hire people from certain countries anymore.<p>I have done lots of things to be able to relocate to Amsterdam.
My husband &amp; I had already resigned from our jobs, I sold my car and all my belongings much less than their actual price, I rented out my house in a long term contract, I traveled between Mazandaran (Where I Live) and Tehran (Where the Embassy of NL located) for several times to collect needed documents (it takes 10 hours by car for a round trip). I packed all my things. I changed all my money to euros and finally I was waiting for my flight when I have received the booking offer withdrawal email. it was a shock to me. Also my family was indirectly affected by this unsuccessful migration. They were hurt financially and emotionally.<p>I want to ask booking.com once again the question I asked in my previous emails. How does booking.com want to compensate for the financial and emotional damage it has caused to me and people like me?<p>At the end, I want to use a Persian proverb and tell you that “[racism] has no horns and tail&quot;. This means that the devil face of the racism is not always visible. Racism is exactly your behavior when you shout Diversity as a value of your company and instead suddenly decide not to hire any more people from Iran.<p>Hope this post helps people to choose the right company to join and to book!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
