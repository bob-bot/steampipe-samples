- get to know US and its people (yes I know there seem to be higher crime rates in the west but idc)

It&#x27;s a place for AI artists to share and organise their work. I noticed that lots of artists post their work primarily on Twitter and there&#x27;s no easy way to see all their work in one place. Whenever I&#x27;d ask to see all their work they&#x27;d either sheepishly point me to their Twitter &quot;Media&quot; tab or I&#x27;d have to comb through 5 different NFT platforms and aggregate it myself. I built a little tool called &quot;&#x2F;publish&quot; that lets you create a gallery for your AI art without leaving Twitter. You just reply to a tweet containing your artwork with &quot;&#x2F;publish @superprompts&quot; and we add it to your gallery.<p>Now I&#x27;ve built a fun little tool that lets you generate AI art with Stable Diffusion without leaving Twitter. You can tweet &quot;&#x2F;generate @superprompts&quot; followed by your prompt, and we&#x27;ll generate the art, publish it to Super Prompts, and reply to your tweet with your creation. It&#x27;s completely free but it does require you to sign up on Super Prompts and verify your Twitter first.<p>I&#x27;m using Google Cloud Functions to check for new Twitter mentions every minute and handle accordingly. To generate the art I&#x27;m using Replicate [2].

33164377,Show HN: My book for programmers called “Junior to Senior” was published today,2022-10-11T15:18:44Z,dglass,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"After a four year journey, the book I wrote to help junior and mid-level programmers earn their first promotion was published today . The book is titled Junior to Senior: Career Advice for the Ambitious Programmer and is now available on Holloway’s website[0].<p>I truly believe that soft-skills are what makes the difference between a good programmer and a great one. I also believe that anyone can learn the soft-skills needed to accelerate their programming career.<p>I wish I’d had better resources to learn these things in the early years of my career and I’m hoping this book will become a useful resource for the next generation of programmers to build successful careers.<p>What this book covers:<p>Choosing a career path: generalist vs. specialist<p>What makes you a senior engineer?<p>How to deal with feeling like an impostor<p>How to build trust and work with your manager<p>How to recover when you make a mistake, and what to do during incidents<p>How to ask better questions<p>How to read and understand unfamiliar code<p>How to add value to your team and company<p>How to identify and manage risk<p>How to deliver better results<p>How to communicate more effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences<p>The importance of a healthy work-life balance<p>How to ask for a promotion, and how to prepare for it<p>I wrote this book because these soft-skills are rarely taught in coding bootcamps or computer science degrees, yet they are critical to every programmer’s career trajectory. Almost every programmer I know, including me, had to learn and develop these soft-skills on the job. It took hard work and a lot of trial and error to learn how to communicate my ideas effectively, navigate office politics, manage risk, and so many other things that programmers encounter in their jobs today.<p>Get instant lifetime access at holloway.com.
