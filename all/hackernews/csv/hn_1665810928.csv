Doesn&#x27;t apply to all of them (but won&#x27;t fit in the title)<p>A very cynical take I&#x27;ve heard is that it acts as a class filter, just as is higher education. A somewhat less cynical view is that it&#x27;s favoritism and trust, just like how people from certain top schools tend to hire those from other top schools with less harsh judgment.<p>However, I am really more interested in the apparent paradox that most internships present, in that they&#x27;re accessible to students, people already in a better-off position to enter the professional world, but less accessible for those not in school, who actually need to work more to get in a similar good standing for a career.
