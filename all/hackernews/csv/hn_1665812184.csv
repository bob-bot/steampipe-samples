Doesn&#x27;t apply to all of them (but won&#x27;t fit in the title)<p>A very cynical take I&#x27;ve heard is that it acts as a class filter, just as is higher education. A somewhat less cynical view is that it&#x27;s favoritism and trust, just like how people from certain top schools tend to hire those from other top schools with less harsh judgment.<p>However, I am really more interested in the apparent paradox that most internships present, in their accessible to students, people already in a better-off position to enter the professional world. But having the majority of them being inaccessible for those not in school, who actually need more help to get in a similar good standing for a career. In this comparison a student is getting a &quot;double serving&quot; of benefits. Is it as simple as risk factors that companies don&#x27;t want to take into consideration with self-taught people?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
