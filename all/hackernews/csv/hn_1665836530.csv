33213976,An answer to: why is Nvidia making GPUs bigger when games don't need them?,2022-10-15T11:48:20Z,stephanst,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve had this discussion a few times recently including with people who are pretty up-to-date engineers working in IT. It&#x27;s true that the latest offerings from Nvidia both in the gaming and pro range are pretty mind-boggling in terms of power consumption, size, cost, total VRAM etc... but there is actually a very real need for this sort of thing driven by the ML community, maybe more so than most people expect.<p>Here is an example from a project I&#x27;m working on today. This is the console output of a model I&#x27;m training at the moment:<p>-----------------------------<p>I1015 20:04:51.426224 139830830814976 supervisor.py:1050] Recording summary at step 107041.

And bear in mind this is a relatively small model, which can be deployed on a stamp-size Intel Movidius TPU and run in real-time directly inside a tiny sensor. For non-realtime inference there are people out there working on models with 1000x more parameters!<p>So if anyone is wondering why NVIDIA keeps making more and more powerful GPUs, and wondering who could possibly need that much power... this is your answer: the design &#x2F; development of these GPUs is now being pulled forward 90% by people who need these kinds of solutions for ML ops, and the gaming market is 10% of the real-world &quot;need&quot; for this type of power, where 10 years ago that ratio would have been reversed.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
