After 2 - 3 hard failures today we did an emergency JunOS downgrade and are cautiously optimistic that it&#x27;s resolved.<p>Longer&#x2F;technical version:<p>For the past month or so we&#x27;ve been suffering a weird issue where random IP addresses would stop responding. The issue is that our router would lose&#x2F;expire out the ARP entry for these IP addresses and wouldn&#x27;t attempt to learn them again unless forced to.<p>No amount of traffic getting sent to the IP externally (pings, random connection attempts, etc) would make the router issue an ARP &quot;who-has&quot; message. The only fix was to either ping the IP on the LAN (through our speedtest page for instance), forcing the router to see the ARP message on the network, or to login to the router and ping from there.<p>No amount of limits, tweaks, process restarts, etc, has helped with this. The only way to date has been the above methods.<p>This morning we had an issue where all users on REDACTED.x.x dropped offline. These subnets had been moved down to our new Cisco core switch to help resolve the issue. Our Juniper router dropped the ARP entry for the Cisco switch, killing BGP. After some time it re-learned then entry reestablished connectivity, bringing those subnets back online.<p>This happened three times in the past 24 hours, each outage lasting anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes.<p>Las Vegas is the only location suffering this issue. The key difference between all locations being that Vegas was running JunOS 20.4, where as everywhere else is 18.2~4. In JunOS 20.x they made changes to ARP to allow policing. While we did change this policy, it didn&#x27;t help us any.<p>As of an hour ago we performed a downgrade to JunOS 18.4. It obviously went terribly. After some research we found the configuration entry causing issues (our 100G ports kept channelizing) and fixed it, bringing things back online.<p>As of now, ARP&#x27;s are resolving near instantaneously, even for new IP addresses. We took this as a good time to change the rest of our ports to 100G, giving us a 400Gbit interlink between our router and core switch.<p>We&#x27;re cautiously optimistic that this issue is now resolved.<p>We thank you for your patience.<p>BuyVM Team",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;m building an app to solve exactly this problem. The idea is to build an app that will allow users to meet new people with same interests through 1:1 audio calls. In this app users will choose topics that interests them like startup, dance, music, sports etc. Then whenever they will want, they will be able to instantly connect to a random person who shares same interests as them for a voice chat.
App will generate revenue through ads &amp; subscription.<p>I have already built an MVP &amp; done market validation with initial users. The response was quite good. Similar apps exist in the market like Maum (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;maum.app) &amp; Dialup (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dialup.com) I have some ideas to make a better version of them.<p>I&#x27;m a native android developer &amp; i was developer of Vently app (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.peerhose). I know some app marketing as well. I can make the android version of the app. I&#x27;m looking for a native or hybrid app developer to preferably make the iOS version.
I know the importance of marketing so I&#x27;m looking for a marketing guy as well to help us double down on marketing. If you do not officially consider yourself a marketer but you are really interested in doing marketing then you can join too. We will work on 80&#x2F;20 principle. 80% marketing 20% developement.<p>Revenue and equity will be split equally between all members. Feel free to reach out if you are an app developer or a marketer.<p>Bonus: Getting first 5,000 users is on me!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
