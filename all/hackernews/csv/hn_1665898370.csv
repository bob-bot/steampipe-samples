I intended to implement the replication and restriction primitives soon. I find process algebras very interesting. They seem to be an important area of research, to bring the computing ecosystem to a concurrent-first paradigm.<p>This github project isn&#x27;t much to look at currently; it&#x27;s my first project of any substance.
