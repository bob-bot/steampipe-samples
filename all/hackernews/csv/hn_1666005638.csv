I’m not a wunderkind or anything, but I enjoy consulting-type work and the feedback I get is that I add value to projects. Theoretically I should be able to build a small consulting firm out of my skills and network.<p>However, I have a real issue with charging people for work. It’s not a self worth issue, I know I do good work. It’s simply that helping is enough.<p>If money did not exist I would be perfectly happy learning organically about the business problems of the people around me, research a bit with them, come up with a solution, implement it and move on without any compensation. Conversely, if I am asked to work on a pointless death-march project that is really well paid I just can’t sustain my interest long enough to see it through.<p>Has anybody found themselves in this situation? How did you work through it? I’m starting to realise that if I don’t figure this out I’ll have to go back to the job market. It just seems so _silly_ to fail at this because getting paid is not interesting to me.<p>For background, I am a data scientist. As with most people in my field, I come from somewhere else (finance) and dabble right across the stack.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
