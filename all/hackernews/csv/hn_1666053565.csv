People seemed to like my stuff, and I made a lot of friends (tweeps) on there in the process. I&#x27;m still just as active, but I&#x27;ve noticed a sharp decline in engagement with my account. Retweets, hearts, and replies have all dwindled, everyone seems too busy and focused on whatever flavor-of-the-month celebrity or political figure is tweeting.<p>They don&#x27;t care about small little niche accounts anymore. It&#x27;s all about k-pop and African memes, and replying to Elon Musk&#x27;s tweets and other fandom. People just don&#x27;t seem to have the time to focus on the smaller accounts.<p>I mostly tweet web development stuff, and was seriously considering pivoting to another topic just to get back that original engagement that I used to enjoy. And further, the web development scene now has countless copycat accounts doing &#x27;threads&#x27; where they explain basic HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS and other concepts, and the engagement for that is pretty high.<p>But it&#x27;s basic stuff you can just read in various man-pages&#x2F;Docs and just re-cycled for Twitter to get likes and clicks. It&#x27;s not groundbreaking research or niche content, or, original in any way.<p>So what&#x27;s happening here? Should I delete my account and re-spawn somewhere else where I&#x27;ve a greater chance at being heard?<p>BTW: I&#x27;m not revealing the account in question for privacy reasons.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
