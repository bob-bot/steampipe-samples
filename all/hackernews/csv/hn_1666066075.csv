I&#x27;m looking to tie this all together.<p>What would be the best solutions for this:
I see Axiom as an option but i&#x27;m unsure about credentials and how I would trigger it to run the chrome plug-in once a webhook has been processed.<p>Or would I use Selenium some how record what I do and have it mimic that but change input data and it can spit out code I can run on a local server?<p>Basically I have to manually assign a user to a project assign permissions and change the project name.<p>I&#x27;m going to be doing it manually but the process might become overwhelming if I get too many requests.<p>Thank you for the advice in advance.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
