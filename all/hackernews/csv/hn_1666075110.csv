I’ve been contacting OpenAI support but never heard back.<p>My account is suspended due to the unpaid $0.07 invoice. I couldn’t pay because I live in a country where OpenAI API is not available. Fair enough. Although I&#x27;ve stated that I owned a US LLC and was using the US debit card.<p>So I wanted to remove all my personal info, including payment methods but I just couldn’t. It keeps throwing the same error message[0]<p>I send a request asking for account closure. Still never heard anything from them[1]. Like I was shadow-banned or something. What can I do to have my account deleted? I live in Vietnam, so I have something like GDPR rights?<p>Thanks.<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;qwzLcox
