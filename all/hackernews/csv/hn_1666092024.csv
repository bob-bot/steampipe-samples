I am an ex-scientist who moved to scientific sales. I started developing a tool for myself which turned into an exciting SaaS product - solid value proposition, keen interest from my network, positive feedback on an early prototype.<p>Our tech stack is the following:
- AWS cloud and EC2 instances for hosting FE and BE
- MongoDB for the storage database
- Go Lang is on the backend serving the rest API endpoints (might move to nodejs&#x2F;nestjs)
- FE is done as monolith React SPA<p>The company is set up and interest is growing, but both of my developers are working part-time, so we are looking for extra hands to join us in developing MVP.<p>At the moment we all work pro bono, but shed no tears - we can offer referrals, recommendations, paid positions in the future, and of course, an exciting project to work on.<p>Don&#x27;t get stuck in one project as Bill Gates did - get in touch to see how you could join!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
