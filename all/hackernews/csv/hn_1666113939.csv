I tried talking to my manager about this, he told me he can do nothing about this, considering the CEO is the owner of a multi-million dollar company. BTW, I am from Western Europe, totally illegal. If I rat them out to the authorities, even anonymously, I am sure they&#x27;d take vengeance on me.<p>I&#x27;m at a complete loss right now, second hand smoking is as everyone knows deadly, and it&#x27;s taken me a LOT of work (networking, studying, etc...) to get this (first ever) job. I&#x27;m in my early 20s.<p>I will start wearing a FFP3&#x2F;N100 mask from now on to work (even if they&#x27;re not fully effective) and do everything I can to avoid the smoke&#x2F;odor.<p>Quitting is almost a non-starter because I&#x27;d be unhireable in a field where there&#x27;s work but there&#x27;s not that much work. Plus, who would hire someone who quit his job 3 months into it?<p>I actually went to college for CS for a year, but ended up dropping out after failing all of my subjects due to what I believe lack of a work ethic (I mean, I literally even failed a non-CS related subject). I&#x27;m also not that bright, I am not going to lie.<p>So, to avoid all of this... or at least give it a try at avoiding all of this, I would like to become a remote (or not!) dev within a year, by doing everything I can (projects, learning how to code, networking, etc.) in my evenings.<p>I know this is going to be hell of earth for me, but I have no alternative -there is no guarantee another job within the logistics industry doesn&#x27;t have something similar to this.<p>Please, tell me, what should I try learning to accomplish this, I don&#x27;t care, web, programming, databases, etc...

I&#x27;ve never had a proper &quot;job&quot;. My life has been filled with setbacks and I&#x27;m currently in my 20s.<p>After many wasted years I finally completed an apprenticeship in computer science which is titled &quot;Computer Science Expert&quot; (although I&#x27;m far from being an expert). I&#x27;ve moved countries and since been hopelessly looking for work.<p>I got all basic&#x2F;surface level skills about programming (primarily python and some c++ and little java), I understand html&#x2F;css, networking, servers and batch&#x2F;powershell&#x2F;bash scripting.<p>I&#x27;m willing to learn new things and can expand my knowledge rather quickly.
What I&#x27;m ultimately looking for is a 100% remote job (I&#x27;m in the EU and an EU citizen) that gives me the opportunity to get started and grow from there.
