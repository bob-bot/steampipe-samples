Our filesystems and URI&#x27;s are the last hierarchical standouts we have that haven&#x27;t adopted some form of tagging. Hierarchies make sense, and allow for different groups and subgroups to exist with their respective elements inside, however we sometimes have needs to share these files among other hierarchies so we delegate authority to the libraries on the system, or create symlinks across various paths.<p>Have there been attempts at tag-based filesystems? We already do symlinks, and have constructs in the UI&#x27;s of some desktop environments for tagging documents as work&#x2F;personal&#x2F;financial, but what if the tag system also delegated role-based and scoped resource access per-process? What if the tag system could favor one library version over another, and the system could provide a default? It wouldn&#x27;t be hard to imagine this going hand in hand with deterministic systems.<p>Initially, this thought experiment resulted in the idea of an imaginary Qubes or OpenBSD like system where each process or process group would have a role-based quota of resources based on different tagged attributes.<p>I don&#x27;t have a product to pitch by this post, I&#x27;m genuinely asking for the thinkers and dreamers out there to think for a moment, if a tag is used over a hierarchy, what would a tag-based filesystem look like? how would it perform differently?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The app had been on something less than life-support for years, but it&#x27;s even more frustrating that they won&#x27;t even work come November.<p>I used to recommend this company and have a number of their devices, one of which I only bought a few years ago.<p>Full email:<p>---
Dear Users,<p>Thank you for your long-term support of Awair devices! We wanted to update you with information on the future of our device support.<p>Awair has made it possible for you to know what’s in your air since 2013. Some of our oldest devices (Glow&#x2F;Glow-C&#x2F;Awair V1) are no longer able to update firmware, and so we will be sunsetting these oldest devices starting on November 30, 2022. What is sunsetting? In short, your device will lose app support and the ability to connect to Awair&#x27;s Cloud services. It will still continue to measure air quality, provided it is onboarded before this date and is not factory reset. The air data will only be accessible via the device&#x27;s front screen (if it has one). Additionally, the Hobbyist API will no longer be serving any requests.<p>In appreciation for your support over the years, we’re working on a new upgrade program that allows our legacy device users to purchase a brand new Awair Element at a discounted price to keep you up to date with your environment. The Element contains upgraded sensors and, unlike the Glow devices, includes PM2.5 and CO2. If this is something you’d be interested in, please let us know at the link below and we’ll send you information once this program is finalized:<p>Legacy Device Upgrade Program Interest<p>Awair is experiencing healthy growth that puts an additional workload and cost on our platform. In order to scale our core functionality cost-effectively, we are prioritizing our resources into scaling our core services that are supporting the functionality. Regrettably, we are currently unable to put our resources into fixing the following features of the Awair Home App, so we will be temporarily removing them until a new version of the app is available for release:<p><pre><code>    Logging into app using Google Sign-In
    Push notifications system
    Integrations with IFTTT, Google Home, Ecobee, Sensi, and SmartThings
    Amazon Alexa in-app controls (can still be controlled through Alexa device itself)
</code></pre>
If you have any questions on the future support of your device or have any trouble accessing the Upgrade Program Interest form, please reach us at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.getawair.com&#x2F;e&#x2F;968753&#x2F;2022-10-18&#x2F;337cd&#x2F;92328830?h=7zeUSUku18SP6vKHTwjE6u4uubkTPuVFczVZlNvjZ-Q so we can work with you from there!<p>Breathe easy knowing that you’re tracking the invisible.<p>The AWAIR team
