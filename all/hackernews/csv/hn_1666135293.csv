33255262,Tell HN: NameCheap Private Email does not delete folders ever,2022-10-18T23:04:33Z,neogodless,4,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"A while back, when Google had announced the end of their free G Suite (aka Google Workspace, aka Gmail for Business) tier, I researched options for an email host that was inexpensive, but supported custom domain names, and catch-all email accounts. Since I already have web hosting with NameCheap, and the prices and features were good, I began to use PrivateEmail.<p>In recent months, when Hacker News users have asked for suggestions, I&#x27;ve recommended them. However, I cannot in good faith do that at this time, because I&#x27;ve discovered a flaw that could be quite problematic. For me, it&#x27;s mostly just really annoying.<p>The issue was discovered because Outlook for Android does not give you options for which folders you see when connected via IMAP. So after I had inadvertently created an Archive folder, and subsequently deleted it, it continued to show up in Outlook, and I could not (and still cannot) find a way to hide it.<p>What I discovered via the WebMail that NameCheap Private Email provides is that they do not <i>delete</i> folders, ever. Worse, the emails inside of &quot;deleted&quot; folders are also not deleted. For the sake of convenience, I took 4 screenshots, and uploaded them to imgur: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;4RdzQjY<p>1. A folder with an email in it is deleted<p>2. I empty the trash<p>3. Going over to settings &gt; mail &gt; change imap subscriptions, I can see any deleted folders still exist and are merely unsubscribed by NameCheap Private Email&#x27;s webmail client. I re-subscribe and save.<p>4. The folder is back, along with the email inside.<p>I&#x27;ve reached out to support, but so far have only been able to reach a level of support that attempts to walk me through how to use their webmail, including deleted folders and emptying the trash. I&#x27;m hoping I can escalate it further so that an issue can be opened and resolved.<p>One more note - while I demonstrated above using their webmail, the same happens if I use Thunderbird, and delete folders. They are not deleted, but merely hidden from some clients. However, other clients, like Outlook for Android, continue to see these hidden folders.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It is written in Swift and uses AppKit framework.<p>It is a Mac-first app which is built for the macOS design language. It looks and feels and works like a proper macOS app made with love and care. It is not a port of an iOS nor an iPadOS app nor anything else. I am quite proud of it and I hope you can appreciate it too.<p>So, I recently updated it to version 3.0 with new features such as tracking stories by marking it as (un)read, (un)favourite and (un)hidden. There is also folder management to organise stories and smart folders that track stories by certain attributes.<p>It also supports the Touch Bar with customisations.<p>I would love it, if you could try it out and let me know what you think of it! I welcome feedback and please do let me know if there are any bugs or crashes. I did all the testing myself to the best of my ability.<p>Oh and about the in-app purchases, it is just the tip jar and it is completely optional. The app and all its features are absolutely free to use.<p>If you like HacKit, please kindly leave feedback on the App Store. It really helps, no really!<p>Have a good week!",story,https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/hackit/id1549557075?mt=12,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
