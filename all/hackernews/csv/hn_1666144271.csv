Under my guidance we&#x27;ve started to branch our business into web educational content, selling online courses and webinars.<p>It&#x27;s all been fine and dandy, our experiments have shown that it&#x27;s worth continuing but now I got to figure out how we&#x27;re going to host our video content and serve it. Previously we just used private YouTube embeds in our customer-facing LMS, but with the ads on YouTube, the user experience could be better. I&#x27;m also not 100% sure it&#x27;s according to YouTube&#x27;s TOS.<p>We would&#x27;ve used Vimeo, but their new plans are simply not viable. The monthly video upload limits are too limiting and while we won&#x27;t hit the 2TB monthly transfer bandwidth now, it&#x27;ll become an issue in the next months.<p>I&#x27;ve already built ourselves a nifty little website where we can sell and fulfil customer orders and create private web pages with the video content embedded with an expiration date and it runs basically for free on Netlify.<p>What I&#x27;m wondering is, where the heck should we store the videos so our customers can stream them? Ideally, they wouldn&#x27;t be too easy to download but our customers are also pretty non-tech so piracy isn&#x27;t really something we need to worry about.<p>Currently I&#x27;m weighing my options between something like Streamable, renting some VPS and throwing them all into a webserver and just hotlinking the vids or maybe something like Cloudflare&#x27;s Stream (which is currently a bit complex for me to understand).<p>I&#x27;m mostly an UX designer who likes to tinker and I do run my own home server but I&#x27;m not a great developer so stuff like managing content on AWS through the CLI and uploading files via API calls seems pretty daunting.<p>Any advice? I&#x27;m trying to get the best bang for our buck.<p>Currently we have approximately 200 hours of 1080p video content (some 150GB) and next year it&#x27;ll be somewhere around double or triple that. I guess our average monthly traffic would be 1500-2000 minutes a month.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We basically need to configure a rack with a few replicated DB servers hosting ~10tb of data, and some quad H100 boxes.

There are at least three different types of displays falling under the category of &quot;suggestions&quot;: auto-complete (three words above keyboard), spelling suggestions (red wiggly line+tooltip), and another kind of tooltip that sometimes appears but I still haven&#x27;t figured out.<p>And above all, cursor scrolling using either the spacebar trick or a hard press on screen is a complete mess and usually snaps to some random part of the text, and it is apparently variable and depends on the UI context (behaves differently within URL bars vs. multiline text).<p>I find myself more and more often preferring not to use the phone and waiting to get to an actual computer with a keyboard to type anything beyond a few words.<p>Am I just getting older&#x2F;going through some cognitive decline or is the mobile typing experience actually getting worse?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
