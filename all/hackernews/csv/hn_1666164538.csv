33258670,"No Thanks, I Don't Want to Build a Billion-Dollar Company",2022-10-19T07:05:40Z,prasenjit_pro,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"When I started to build out my SAAS app Proxies API, I didn’t want a billion-dollar company or even a million-dollar company. Those are weird goals and don’t have any power behind them. The why of doing a startup should be so powerful it drives you every morning and every hour on its own. For that, it has to be natural. Lying in reality. A lot of gurus advocate having a strong why to their students. To find you are why they say. Find it SO that you can build a company. The irony and dishonesty of this approach are lost on them. It’s like saying, go find a disease you have so I can cure it. It’s never worked that way. Because you can’t trick yourself. Then why should it be obvious? If it is not, then you can’t wear a psychological version of VR goggles to psyche yourself that there is a why. Here is a strange thought — if you can’t find a way to start a company, then don’t. If you don’t have the motivation to do a startup, then why do you want to do it.<p>I think of it this way- If I know there is a tsunami coming my way in 6 months, and I am on an island, and I have no way to get out, it’s natural for me to plan and do everything in my power to deal with the upcoming threat. I don’t need to find me why. It is natural, and the goal of building a strong tower tall enough to survive the tsunami is not arbitrary. The fear fuels the work that’s needed and the research that’s required.
For me, I had to quit my day job because of the way my personal life was structured. Terrible things would happen, or at least had a high chance of happening if I didn’t become location independent. I can’t share more than this in a public forum, but all you need to know is why I was looking large in front of me, and I had anywhere between a year to 18 months to get independent.<p>After this threat, my calculations are modest. All I needed was to be able to pay rent and sustain living expenses. Period No other jazz was necessary. Figures like a million dollars or think big was laughable guru speak who didn’t have the sense of reality or urgency about my situation. You see, beyond the exact number needed to sustain me a month on month and free from having to work a job, the extra money meant nothing to me.<p>A focus like this is based on fear, a fear that is natural and real. It’s impersonal, and it has great power. It doesn’t stress you out like a personal fear like the fear of humiliation, which is your very own. This is my power. And this made sure I left no stone unturned to get to my goal. Everyday scenarios would play out in my head as to how else I could fail. Failing was not an option, so it fuelled me. I wanted it.<p>A potential billion-dollar company ‘someday’ when my personal life is in tatters is of no use to me. Just earning 2.5 k per month meant everything to me. It’s my dream come true, and possibly a nightmare averted.<p>The author is the founder of Proxies API (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.proxiesapi.com&#x2F;), a proxy rotation API service.<p>This article originally appeared here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.proxiesapi.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;No-Thanks-I-Don&#x27;t-Want-to-Build-A-Billion-Dollar-Company.php",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;m the founder of inboxpirates.com . Inbox Pirates is an email preview tool for sales &amp; marketing teams. It helps you preview how your email actually looks in your receiver&#x27;s inbox.<p>When I was building Crewcharge, an email marketing tool - I needed to build a feature to show a preview of how the email looks. I was searching for inspiration and realised most email preview tools only showed you the email in full screen when it&#x27;s opened as if all emails get opened.<p>While this happened, my friend who is a digital marketer sent an email to himself and grabbed 3 phones around the house. When I asked why, he replied that most people don&#x27;t even open the emails and read it from the notification bars.<p>Another friend missed a job interview because he swiped on the notification thinking it was a promotion.<p>After a survey it was clear than more 75% of the people do the same and that most email marketing or email outreach tools are optimizing for wrong placements.<p>I built this as a chrome extension so it would be open to existing email marketing and email outreach tools in the market. It currently integrates with Google Workspace, Hubspot, Apollo io, Snov io, Mailchimp, Sendinblue, Google Sheets &#x2F; Notion &#x2F; Airtable.<p>The way it works is it parses the dom for the email text (or HTML), subject line, Sender name and creates the previews in a new tab where you can explore how the email looks on Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, Androids, iPhones.<p>Future integrations in pipeline include Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Instantly, Lemlist, Outreach io.<p>Launched on Producthunt reaching #1 product of the day and reached around 450 users, a lot of us discover us on Google when they search for email preview or email testing tools.<p>The vision of inboxpirates is to also give you a good email score to get higher response and open rates, using NLP and the core version is very basic with some bugs.<p>Bootstrapped solo-founder here with a production version, sorry in advance for some of the bugs against specific email clients!<p>I&#x27;ve spent around 5 months building and marketing this tool alone, but I wanted to really see if people cared enough about this problem.<p>Appreciate all thoughts and feedback.

33258684,Tell HN: I asked Signal motivations for SMS removal,2022-10-19T07:07:40Z,quentinus95,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Here is their answer:<p>Hi,<p>Thank you for your thoughts on the announced SMS removal. The blog post describes all of the biggest factors in making this decision, but I know this is a change that is difficult to adjust to, so I wanted to chime in with some additional info that might give some more context.<p>1. RCS (Rich Communications Services) is coming, and it doesn’t play well with Signal. I once had a situation when I was sending SMS to one of my friends via Signal, but I wasn’t seeing any of their responses – this was because their app was automatically responding via RCS, which wasn’t delivered to Signal. This is going to continue to get worse, and Signal cannot add RCS support because there’s no RCS API on Android. Honestly, the days of any third-party SMS app are numbered.<p>2. Proper SMS&#x2F;MMS support is hard. Signal has to support thousands of devices running dozens of versions of Android. Now multiply that by the hundreds of cell carriers running an inherently bad&#x2F;buggy protocol, and you’ll start to understand the weird MMS bugs we can run into. And any time spent trying to fix them is time invested in an insecure protocol.<p>3. SMS&#x2F;MMS has plenty of its own bugs. Remember that incident a few years ago in which everyone got old Valentine’s SMS messages delivered 9 months later? It was an SMS protocol bug for which some users blamed Signal. Other weird bugs like temporarily-split MMS groups, bad image quality, and the general inability to leave MMS groups are flaws in MMS that also get attributed to us.<p>4. Spam. My goodness, SMS spam is a real thing, and many people who use Signal cannot tell the difference between SMS spam and Signal messages if both come through Signal. They think we’re responsible for the spam.<p>5. Finally, Signal having SMS support gives a lot of people the wrong impression of SMS. They think that because SMS is being sent through Signal, it’s actually secure or as secure as an encrypted Signal-to-Signal message, and that’s just not true. We can add unlocked padlock icons to each SMS message, and we can label the message compose box as “insecure”, but the misunderstanding would continue. The only thing we can do is store the SMS messages encrypted on the device, but in my opinion that matters very little when anyone who wants your SMS messages can just get them all from your cell carrier.<p>In short, SMS is on its way out in general, and in a world where Signal supports SMS, all of SMS shortcomings are often attributed to Signal itself, all while confusing people into thinking their SMS messages are secure.<p>In my opinion, a secure SMS app does not exist. Just choose the one with the best layout or usability, and preferably one that supports RCS (which I believe at this point are Google and Samsung Messages), because at least then there’s some chance that they might end up being encrypted in the future.<p>I hope that helps give some more context. And please know that I understand this is difficult to adjust to. I can relate. I’ve used Signal as my SMS app for over 6 years, but I truly think it’s for the best.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
