I&#x27;m Rishabh, and I&#x27;ve been building MRKTPLACE; a place for thinkers to post and trade meaningful ideas.<p>By allowing thinkers to purchase ideas in a free market, we can understand their worldview with more nuance due to the additional price signal adding weight to each of their beliefs. At the same time, this encourages thinkers to come up with better thoughts.<p>I tried building tooling which recommends research papers, news articles, youtube, etc. as references for each idea, hoping that this leads to higher quality content. However, the recommendation algorithm could still use some work.<p>Currently, we&#x27;re using Goerli testnet, and also giving away free Goerli ETH to all users on signup so they can start trading right away.<p>I&#x27;m curious to know how people feel about trading ideas with made-up currency vs. real money. Although made-up currency is much more accessible, using real money enables some interesting use cases. Eg: humanitarian foundation posting on the platform and being directly able to get paid, a musical artist releasing content for purchase, etc.<p>Please let me know if you find this platform&#x2F;concept interesting! Would love any feedback.<p>PS: Please support us on ProductHunt! I&#x27;m bootstrapping this and could use every bit of support!

All because of parenting?<p>Parenting is trending today on HN and I loved the comments. It inspired me to write about a thing I do well that I never thought about before.<p>Coming from someone who had these feeling from time to time, but almost never ponder on them, here is how I do it.<p>I noticed this is true not only in parenthood, but in everything else.<p>What worked for me in parenthood and marriage and sports:<p>1. Nip it in the bud. As soon as I start thinking about regrets I go and DO something positive now. I did have times when I pondered past (but that was in high-school and I had enough of a lesson that pondering won’t solve anything)
2. Loose hope it’ll get better (I’ve read about a POW in Vietnam war, he was like the longest captive pow in history. He said the guys who died or were in the worst condition first were the ones who hoped they’ll be out by Christmas or other important date)
3. Find joy in obstacles (the more unique obstacles you have the more unique perspective and gift you can give to your children and the world)
4. Hang out with your tribe even if it’s only virtually (whatever happens it’s nicer when you share it and you see other people have it similar)
5. Think about the future when it’s a high likelihood you will look at this moment and wish you’re back (it might help you put things into perspective)<p>One of these five is bound to help. If you have anything to add please do.<p>Also, if you like the post please check my weekly newsletter for remote-working parents in my profile. I cover a lot of relevant things there every week.<p>P.S. I know I&#x27;m coming in hot with the post. Raw and unedited.
