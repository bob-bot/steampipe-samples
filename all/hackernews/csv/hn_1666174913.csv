This is my business website (down) and email (down) thanks to GoDaddy. They are doing the usual dishonest business practices - &quot;You need to buy 4 baby geckos and a blue gatorade, drink it at exactly 4pm eastern time and call us in 5 days and we will be able to give you access to your account to reroute your dns servers.&quot;  Their excuses are ridiculous and constantly change.  I emailed over 20 executives there and they didn&#x27;t respond.  I have filed with BBB  + FCC but I just want my website and email access so I can stop losing money (I lost large paying jobs due to them - this has been a week!).   Can anyone offer any help to get them to give me access to my account (they did finally) to move my dns servers away from them (they are still requiring me to verify my identity using the email address that they have that they won&#x27;t give me access to. I got them to waive their ridiculous 24 day period to simply add my personal email to my account so I can get access to this verification.  Nope!  They can&#x27;t use my personal email address because they can&#x27;t explain why, they can only use the business email address that is blocked by them.   Furthermore - they actually told me it takes &quot;at least 72 hours&quot; to be able to get a text message from them to do 2 factor authentication - the &quot;only other way to give you access to your account.&quot;   They just keep lying.  Help ?? Thank you!<p>Edited to add - I am paid in full for the entire year for SSL  + Domain , and they were supposed to have my DNS servers pointed at them, not at another company I used before them that doesn&#x27;t even have servers for me to point at.   They are still blaming me and refusing to give me my account.  They were fine asking me to stop contacting their executives though.  I said no chance until they give me my account back -  I have 25 cells and emails for execs there.  None responded, not shocking but usually if it gets this bad with any other large corporation they respond immediately and resolve it.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
