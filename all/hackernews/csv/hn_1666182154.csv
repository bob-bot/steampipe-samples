I don’t know whether it’s worth looking at changing careers, trying to stick with it or something else I haven’t thought of. I’ve been working in the industry for 14 years and feel like I’m old and jaded. I got a bit burnt out a couple of years ago working 70-hour weeks and haven’t been able to bounce back since. Now, whenever I’m coding, it just feels like an enormous effort to get anything done. I’ve tried to work on different projects and things that are more in line with my interests, but that hasn’t really seemed to help. I’ve worked in various management roles over the years and have been drawn more towards that side of things at the moment, mainly because it isn’t coding. I feel like I’m average at best as a manager, but I have ASD so there are a few aspects of it that I really struggle with. I feel like I could work on these aspects, but it will always be draining and it will never be easy the way coding used to be. The other problem with management is that most people want you in-house for that, whereas I enjoy the freedom of contracting.<p>Has anyone come back from being burnt out to love what they do again? If so, how did you manage to do it?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

- Build pages from predefined components
- Customize pages right in my browser
- Deploy my website with a single click<p>Probably the most interesting feature of the product is the page editor. With the editor, you can quickly build new pages using predesigned building blocks, built with React and Tailwind, and customize them to your liking right in the browser. The editor generates the preview on the client side, which makes the editing experience really nice. You can only use a fixed set of npm packages at the moment.<p>Let me know if you want to build an actual website with it and I can create an account for you.",story,https://console.makery.app,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The goal is to allow developers to write, debug, and verify a normal monolithic application, start up a few generic .NET &quot;runner&quot; services, and then quickly and easily add support for distributed execution of specific portions of their code on those runners, without the traditional overhead that comes with explicitly writing and orchestrating multiple unique services.<p>I had this idea years ago but only recently found time to create a side-project to explore it. While I do not have as much free time as I&#x27;d like to work on it, it is now functional enough as a proof-of-concept to share and see if maybe there is value to someone else.
