The pricing structure and logic always end up being coupled with the core application code and the billing platform. The product catalog is typically managed in spreadsheets, by the product &amp; monetization teams, while all the possible package types, including the legacy ones, are typically hardcoded across different git repositories.<p>Together with our founding team, we have decided to devote ourselves to help solve this problem, and make it much easier for developers everywhere to build out pricing.<p>At Stigg, we’re building APIs and SDKs that allow engineering teams to safely launch and roll-out pricing plan changes, faster. At their core, our APIs allow you to model any pricing (Trials, Freemium, Usage-based, Subscriptions, Per seat) and handle the access control and provisioning logic. We’re trying to build our platform in such a way that after the first integration, any future changes could be deployed by anyone - allowing developer teams to free-up their time from this tedious maintenance work.
We have planned ahead and have already introduced reach functionally like plan migrations and versioning, multiple environments support, a&#x2F;b testing, and embeddable components you can use such as paywall widget, or customer portal widget. This way, you can ship pricing plans without having to do a full Phd on pricing &amp; billing ontology.<p>We&#x27;re just getting started and have a bunch of things on our roadmap. But we’d love to get feedback from the HN community to check that we’re on the right way.",story,https://docs.stigg.io/docs/welcome-to-stigg,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
