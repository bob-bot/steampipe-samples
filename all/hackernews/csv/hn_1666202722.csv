Although I can handle both backend and frontend, I am planning a new project where the interesting part is on the client side. Backend needs are pretty straightforwards:<p>- Registration, authentication with option to use social login (Google, Facebook, ...)<p>- a few simple database tables, maybe a file storage<p>- Subcsription monthly billing using Stripe<p>- a few endpoints doing some custom processing<p>I&#x27;d like to avoid having any backend at all, and try using some of the numerous existing Backend as a Service tools, that I can self-host. My criteria are:<p>1. must be lightweight and easy to self-host, Open Source<p>2. must support writing and serving custom API, preferably using Clojure or JVM<p>3. should support relational DB<p>4. should support social login, user registration flows out of the box<p>5. must have a nice REST API, I don&#x27;t care about client SDK language wrappers<p>6. nice to have a Stripe Billing support out of the box or as an add-on<p>I looked at the documentation for Parse, Supabase, AppWrite, Pocketbase and a few other solutions. They all fail the first criteria, since they mostly require a plethora of services running in multiple docker containers. So far, my favourite is Pocketbase. Looks really nice, but it seems the only way to extend it to use it as a library in a Go-based project, which is not my cup of tea.<p>Do you have some recommendation about such a platform that I could check?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
