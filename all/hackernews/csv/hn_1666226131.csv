They pushed Instagram profiles, and they were all cosmetic ... parts ...<p>That&#x27;s fine if people want to do that to themselves, but on a dating platform it seems clear that they are trying to gather marks or customers.  I assumed (naivel?) that Bumble was intented to be a legit service.  So I tried to report a couple of profiles.  And I discovered that it is impossible to report anything since the captcha is unwinnable.  I&#x27;m certain I entered the correct letters or numbers, but Bumble rejected them.

Building and deploying it has been a great learning experience, and in that spirit I&#x27;d be grateful any thoughts or suggestions if you care to take a look. Thank you!<p>source: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3giqrBU"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3giqrBU</a><p>Why:<p>Composing music is different for everyone, yet some practices are employed by many musicians. One such practice is to record a musical idea on a phone, capturing the idea at its freshest, and for many, clearest. This often leads to a lengthy catalogue of chronologically organized recordings that can be difficult to parse when sitting down to flesh out a piece of music – what matters most is the content of the idea, more so than when it was conceived. The purpose of SoundSeeker is to allow you to organize musical ideas based on their content instead of when they came to be, and to serve as an educational personal project in my growth as a software engineer.<p>What:<p>A graph-based organizational tool for scratch audio recordings<p>Planned features:<p>in-app audio recording, in-app editing, custom labeling outside of the main tiered organizational system.",story,https://www.soundseeker.app,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
