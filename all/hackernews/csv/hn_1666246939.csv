Also I am not sure if using websocket is good enough to transfer files(so I can re-use the source&#x27;s api http server connection) or whether I should send data directly via length-value &quot;protocol&quot; or some another one. Compression is obvious. But other than that I am not sure what modern CDNs use today.<p>What are some standard CDN architectures for distributing the files these days?,story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
