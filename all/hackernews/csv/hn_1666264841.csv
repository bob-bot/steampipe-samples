Want to bet the opt out link itself contains tracking&#x2F;spyware links and wouldnt even open on my Iphone?<p>Some choice cuts from their email:<p>&quot;
Your digital badge will be block-chain secured ensuring that your certification status can only be used by you, including for employer verification that your certification is valid. During these times of digital insecurity, a forgery-proof digital badge provides the greatest protection and modern form of your personal certification.<p>We look forward to hearing from you within the next two weeks. If we do not hear from you, we will assume that you would like to receive your digital badge and SkillsClub invitation and we will arrange for it to be created as described above.

Blender is sufficiently different from everything I know, though, that I feel my experience is more of a hindrance than a benefit.<p>Now the plan is to just go with the flow and do things the Blender way.<p>Does anyone know a course that teaches the basics and enough basic modeling to get started?<p>- Payed courses are OK<p>- Video is preferred<p>- Language must be English or German<p>It should be less than 8 hours long, shorter and high info density is better. On platforms that pay creators by course length (Udemy AFAIK) most courses are dragged ridiculously and I don&#x27;t have time for that.<p>Any tips and hints greatly appreciated!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
