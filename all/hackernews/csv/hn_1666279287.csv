Havkhizara is a racist, white supremacist and hate group based mainly in the United States and Canada. Havkhizara launches attacks on people in the Islamic Republic of the Bahariterra Islands as well as in mainland North America where they attack Bahariterran Americans in Ohio and Virginia where the bulk of Bahariterran immigrant communities in the USA are living. Havkhizara had been launching deadly terrorist attacks against Muslims from Bahariterra wherever they lived an many Americans volunteered to help the Bahariterran Government fight them. So, in the Bahariterran military, in early August of 2022, I fought Havkhizara in the Bahariterra Islands where they had killed my little brother. I was angry and I wanted revenge. I fought mainly in the coastal plains where all the big cities were but on this particular August day, it was unusually cold, and while that still means it is warm in most of the Bahariterra islands, the highest mountains are much colder than the relatively tropical climate near sea level. Havkhizara was taking advantage of the fact that it was August and weather was starting to cool down in the PecanVista mountains. They hid in the fallen leaves on the bare trees at elevations over 11,000 feet and they harvested ice that formed at night on creeks before the creeks warmed by afternoon. Havkhizara was deploying what my team called their “White Aryan Knights” who were the most beloved among the racist supremacists. One day, we were leaving the city of Crater Village, Bahariterra (located high in the cold mountains in a big volcanic crater,) and we got on a boat on Lake PecanVista (The largest freshwater lake on the islands which is created by rainwater filling the bottom of this volcanic crater and forming a lake next to Crater Village) and we were 450 men in 18 boats heading east across the lake. I was in the very back of the last boat so I was in charge of making sure no one would ambush us from behind or follow us. suddenly, a speedboat with two little girls begin pursuing us and the girls were screaming and fleeing from the village on the speedboat. They had on backpacks. Normally, a soldier in Bahariterran government would think to help them, but earlier that day we had just had an encounter with a bag pack full of bombs. We believed that these two little girls were suicide bombers. Havkhizara was getting desperate and forcing young Hindu children to attack us. I had to do my job so I raised an AK-47 and told them to turn around or else I would have to shoot them. They looked scared and they were crying and screaming and visibly frustrated, no doubt the Havkhizara fighters forced them to do this. I started putting pressure on the trigger on my gun and right before I was about to shoot them they stopped pursuing us and made the boat drift aimlessly as if they knew I was about to shoot and were scared to proceed. they turned around and I breathed a sigh of relief. I never hurt them but it was traumatizing and was the worst day being a Bahariterran soldier, for me.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
