It is a world I didn’t know existed, and it has been a very rewarding experience. Two highlights are:<p>* Because the domain is so specific, there is little code out there that I can reuse, which means there is more room for crafting abstractions. For the first time, for instance, I was able to put my compiler-writing experience to good use in a commercial project, by developing a DSL to define regulations, and creating an editor that allows domain experts to modify them. This is definitely more interesting than other applications that I have built in the past.<p>* Because the problem is so concrete and I am close to the users, I get to see their joy when the software does exactly what they need, removing friction and sources of frustration from their daily tasks. I also have their trust to direct the project however I see fit, and I feel like I am being successful at involving them in the software development process, allowing them to understand the trade-offs and to prioritize when there are multiple courses of action.<p>A while ago I came across this comment [1], talking about the advantages of low-volume &#x2F; niche software. The thoughts very much resonated with my own experience. Since then, I have been asking myself: how many of us are out there, developing this kind of software? Please share!

Our vision is to become a leading crypto social trading platform that offers both prop-trade challenge and copy-trade (twisting Etoro&#x27;s business model by combining prop-trade + copy-trade to fit the volatility of crypto markets).<p>The problem?
There is a huge demand for social trading (similar to Etoro) from crypto traders. However, due to the volatile nature of crypto markets, crypto social trading platforms that blindly follow Etoro model do not work. Most copiers there do not gain sustainable profit by copying the top traders but are exposed to significant drawdown risk.<p>Why Tordess?
Combining prop-trade challenges and copy-trade functions can solve the above problem. Being the first prop-trade + copy-trade platform for crypto, we are combining 2 proven business models in stock &amp; forex trading, apply into crypto trading with the aim to disrupt the status quo in its social trading segment.<p>Our progress?
We launched our MVP (open-beta) on October 15th, acquired close to 200 beta users&#x2F;testers as of today and secured affiliate partnership with 2 major Vietnamese crypto trading &amp; prop-trade (Facebook) groups that have more than 200 thousands members.<p>What we are asking for?
Feedback, advice, thoughts, comments, anything that helps us serve crypto traders better.

33278915,Ask HN: Fly.io vs. AWS/GCP/cloud servers vs. host myself elixir phoenix app,2022-10-20T18:45:23Z,mradek,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I built a chat and notification system using Phoenix and I&#x27;ve never deployed this kind of app before.<p>Its for a side project, and I&#x27;m also trying to learn. At home I have a fiber connection (1.2gbps down&#x2F;1.0 up) so I&#x27;m thinking that is plenty of bandwidth for my needs, and if my calculation is correct I could potentially support 100k+ connections on my home server (r9 5900x, 64gb ram).<p>I looked at fly.io and their pricing calculator is confusing (to me), so I&#x27;m wondering if someone can help me understand it by sharing their own experience using it, and how much they pay + the dx.<p>The other option is to spin up something on a cloud provider. I am familiar with AWS, and a little bit with GCP. I could also just get a bare metal linux box.<p>Or.. I could self-host at home where I have a reliable fiber connection.<p>What should I do in this case?<p>I only have experience deploying node and go apps, which seem a lot easier to think about compared to this elixir stuff.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
