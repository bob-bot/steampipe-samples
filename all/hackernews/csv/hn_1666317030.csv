Not a week go by where mentors, managers, and anyone else I come across, doesn&#x27;t advises me to &quot;show impact&quot;. Like what more do you want me to do? I actually straight up asked this question from manager. I&#x27;m not kidding his answer....<p>1) brag I mean mention, your accomplishments and learnings every standup<p>2) write weekly posts about your learning and tag all sister teams<p>3) constantly post in workspace chats<p>4) write RFCs, doesn&#x27;t matter if they ever get read<p>5) brag more in wiki (just half day spamming, like writing resume but daily)<p>I&#x27;m almost being forced to always to do these:<p>- go for flashiest = more people can see and understand == more impact.<p>- go for smallest = you doing 1 task for 8 weeks == bad, you making 3 diffs a week gets you more exposure<p>- go for easiest = you spending solving important and big problems == people seeing your name.<p>It&#x27;s like social media mentality but how whole org is being ran on those principles. On social media your goal is to be always be in front of as many eyeballs as possible.<p>There are amazing engineers on my team. But there is no collaboration, everyone is busy writing their posts. It&#x27;s almost as if teammates are hoping for you to fail hard. So you can&#x27;t outshine them in showing impact. The culture is very &quot;ME&quot; oriented. Everyone is suppose to create a &quot;me brand&quot;.<p>Sure it&#x27;s important to build things that matter, but wtf. You can make a cult out of any concept if you push it to extreme.<p>A friend summarized it nicely; amazon warehouse of programming.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
