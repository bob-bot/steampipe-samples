Needless to say, our mobile app is important to our customers. We are currently experiencing a problem publishing new app versions to Google Play, our app is being flagged as “uploading user’s contact data without consent”. We obviously aren’t doing this, but we also don’t know why Google thinks that we are and it’s not possible to speak to a real person, you only get automated responses when you try and appeal it.<p>Blog post: A longer blog story in Dutch: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.voys.nl&#x2F;blog&#x2F;hoe-google-ons-dwingt-onze-open-source-app-slechter-te-maken&#x2F;",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
