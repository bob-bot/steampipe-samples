Also, if you are taking antibiotics, then you may need to protect the body from the side effects of antibiotics, which means a lot of drugs which almost always are not necessary.<p>Another example, if we have a private clinic in which there is a Very Expensive Device, then often the staff tries to solve all the patient&#x27;s problems with this device, forgetting about diagnostics. We also have federal hospitals where the provision is poor, but at least the doctors try to listen to everything the patient says.<p>Last but not least, some doctors feel it is right to prescribe practices that are not considered part of evidence-based medicine. I usually try to get away from such doctors as soon as possible.<p>Am I the only person who will not take anything until I have studied all the medical literature on my problem that can only be found on torrents? Yes, it&#x27;s thousands of pages with certain pre requirements and I don&#x27;t have a medical education. But we even have people who do not read so much and still do not always trust doctors blindly.<p>Please share your attitude on knowing your body&#x27;s problems and knowing medicine&#x27;s abilities for helping your special problems.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
