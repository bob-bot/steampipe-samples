Lago (YC S21) co-founder here.<p>We&#x27;re big fans of fair billing at Lago, especially when it comes to &#x27;per seat&#x27; pricing. 
Have you ever paid for &#x27;seats&#x27; no one uses? It&#x27;s been a common practice among SaaS for the past 10 years to bill for this. Luckily, some companies, like Notion and Slack took a different approach: only billing active users. 
This typically helps spreading the tool within an organization (anyone can be invited to test). 
The only downside is it can hurt short-term revenue (typically billing for unused seats is still a source of revenue), but our conviction is that it helps with long term trust and growth (at some point the users will remove unused seats anyway, and be resentful).<p>So we&#x27;ve done a teardown of Notion&#x27;s fair pricing, and how they incentivized product discovery through a credit system.<p>We also had a lot of fun showing how our own product could be used to replicate that easily [1].<p>FYI, we build &quot;Open Source Usage Based Billing&quot; (AGPLv3) [2]<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getlago.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;templates&#x2F;notion<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;getlago&#x2F;lago",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

How much impact does a cover letter in comparison to your resume for the success outcome of the application stage?<p>2. What really constitutes a good cover letter?
