It is a reverse thesaurus: you input a detailed description, and the app returns its best guesses.<p>Compared to the existing solutions for this task, phraisely attempts to better understand the full context in your query, making it more accurate when looking up words using long descriptions.<p>For example, if I search for &quot;being home at night watching Netflix on the couch&quot;, results can contain &quot;relaxing&quot; and &quot;unwinding&quot; but also &quot;binge-watching&quot; since I mentioned Netflix. Bonus points when I get some slang in the results (e.g. couch-potatoing).<p>The aim is to have an assistant that writes <i>with you</i>. But it doesn&#x27;t do it <i>for you</i>. Overall, I believe that writing is a frustrating process. Frustration stimulates creativity. And creativity is precious.<p>It is the first functioning version of the app. 
I&#x27;m regularly reviewing the output&#x27;s quality and am working on tailoring it better to user needs. Also, my long term plan would be introducing languages other than English in the results.
