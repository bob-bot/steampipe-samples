I&#x27;m running things on an ESP32 right now and doing an FFT and some other sort of seat-of-the-pants DSP stuff on one core while the other handles bluetooth, LED control, etc. I&#x27;ve got some time to mess around and I&#x27;d like to get a broad strokes overview of the embedded DSP field to inform myself on where to explore next. I&#x27;ve got a fair bit of hands on experience but little formal training.<p>Ultimately the goal is to *make good art* so I&#x27;m not really looking for anything specific. In my head I&#x27;ll get some good papers&#x2F;textbooks&#x2F;libraries&#x2F;articles recommended to me and then I&#x27;ll spend a few weeks to write toy implementations of whatever seems interesting in C to get a feel for the space.<p>I&#x27;m particularly looking for the nitty-gritty type stuff, cool hacks that save cycles and improve latency, my goal here is visceral reactivity and I&#x27;d like to get some more tools in my toolkit that allow me to interpret and combine signals in realtime in interesting ways. Even info on cool math hacks like Carmack&#x27;s fast inverse square root would be appreciated.<p>P.S. Also of interest is material on debugging and modelling realtime code.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
