33296415,Ask HN: Is it possible to have a structured work day in software dev?,2022-10-22T08:06:24Z,vcool07,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Lately, I feel exhausted with all the late night meetings thats required of me at work.  Discussed it with my manager few months ago and he offered to take me off on-call rotation and put me in a leadership role.  While this was good initially, lately this has come up with its own set of challenges, where in I&#x27;m required to have nightly meetings with other teams who are outside of my timezone.  Since I&#x27;m in a leadership role now, my manager says its inevitable as I&#x27;ve to be present in these meetings.<p>I feel so burned out and anxious all the time, not because of overwork, but due to a lack of formal structure in my work day.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of starting out on my own someday, but I wonder, is it even realistic to have a 9-5 kind of structure in IT&#x2F;software dev field ? Whether i work for a big org &#x2F; startup &#x2F; myself, is it inevitable that I have to work round the clock and I&#x27;ve to accept it as a way of life ? Is there a sub-field in software dev where in I can login at a specific time &#x2F; logout at a specific time and not have to worry about work after I log out.<p>PS: Honestly speaking, I used to work at IT service industry not too long ago (perhaps in mid 2000s), where I was working on a boxed software.  Except for some crunch time during major releases, there was no pager duty expected, the pay was average at best and work was monotonous bug fixing, but I felt much more at peace since work was always predictable most of the time.  With this on-call culture thanks to the 99.99 uptime thats become the de-facto industry standard for most companies, I wonder whether such companies exist anymore !",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
