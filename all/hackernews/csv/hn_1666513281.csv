The UI is a regular OS graphic user interface that runs in a web browser and the bulk of the application is a Node.js application for file system traversal, services, and messaging.<p>The goal is to solve for decentralization using a tiered data security model cross-OS. The lowest level, the device level, shares access to resources across the internet without security restrictions. The next level, the user level, allows users to determine which resources to expose for other users to access. Currently file system operations are fully available, in bulk and plurality, to both the security model and browser UI. Text messaging, notifications, and status updates are also exposed. I am working out how to expose application and terminal access in a secure manner to the security model.<p>What features would you suggest I add to this concept? What networked or application features do you wish your current OS had?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
