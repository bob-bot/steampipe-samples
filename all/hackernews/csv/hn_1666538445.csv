It means that you can&#x27;t move to another country while working. So, I created this site to exclusively list fully location independent jobs.<p>Since job boards are a kind of marketplace, I can&#x27;t expect recruiters to post on my site right away, so I started looking for other ways to make the project sustainable. One such plan was to allocate a sponsor slot to earn some money. (between I got lucky and a recruiter from Canada posted a job ad on my site and it had nearly 100 apply clicks)<p>I tried to reach out to few businesses targeted at Digital Nomads to sponsor my site, but none of them turned out as I expected. Everyone said they&#x27;ll think about working with my site in the future. So, I gave up the idea of having sponsors on my site and worked on improving the site.<p>Recently one of my tweet went little viral on Twitter and a course author engaged with that tweet. I quickly invited him to chat to have his course for remote workers advertised on my site. My asking price was actually $199, but he negotiated and we settled for $129.<p>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t want to do B2C, I prefer to do B2B, but somehow this partnership is kind of B2C, but for the first sponsor, it&#x27;s not bad. And a nice way for me to monetize the site. There is a lot to learn about doing sponsorship, so this will definitely help me do that and negotiate offers better.<p>I am happy to learn from you. Please let me know your thoughts below. Thank you.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
