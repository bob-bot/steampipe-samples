33314518,Tell HN: Google closed my non-profit AdSense and Programmable Search accounts,2022-10-24T09:35:26Z,danskeren,4,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I built a non-profit search engine where the plan was to donate 100% of our profits to other non-profit organizations and charities. The organization had been approved by Google as a non-profit and had been successfully running Google Programmable Search Engine for over a year I guess (a lot of the time without ads because AdSense wasn&#x27;t approved until July, and Google makes it possible for non-profits to disable ads).<p>For the first few months we had little traffic and was just shy of our first 600 DKK payout, but in October things seemed to take off and had reached around 2000 DKK by October 17. When I wanted to add a payment method then I encountered the following error:<p>&gt; We couldn&#x27;t complete this action. Try a different verification, payment method, or contact us. [OR-BAAVFT-03]<p>My community forum post was ignored (afaik the only way to contact the AdSense department?), but I managed to get in contact with the Google Pay department who were able to solve the issue. Things were finally coming together and shared my excitement in another HN thread https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33256412#33258630.<p>But when I woke up this morning then saw an email stating &quot;Your Google Publisher Account has been disabled&quot; with the following text:<p>&gt; [...] In your case, we have detected invalid traffic or activity on your account (Publisher Code: pub-1984005958321147) and as a result it has been disabled. [...]<p>I do use MullvadVPN, but I never click on my own ads even if they&#x27;re relevant, and both the search results and ads would appear without problems when using VPN, so I feel it&#x27;s a bit farfetched to blame that on the invalid traffic&#x2F;activity (since they could just opt not to display search results&#x2F;ads for certain IPs).<p>To make matters worse, they even closed my Programmable Search Engine account (cx=9715cb86fd27e9ba0) so now the website is not able to display any search results at all (and can only show instant answers on some queries, e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.moe&#x2F;search&#x2F;web?q=600+dkk+to+usd). I can&#x27;t even access the settings page to review traffic, and Google hasn&#x27;t sent any email regarding the closure of the Programmable Search Engine account.<p>I&#x27;d really appreciate if anybody is able to help or provide suggestions about how to proceed from here. Switching (back) to the Bing Search API is not really an option because it feels impossible to join the Microsoft Advertising network.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
