What people get from Nihilism is that there&#x27;s no point in doing anything because nothing matters in the end. After you die, a few people will remember you. But they will die themselves soon enough, and the memory of your existence will pretty much be gone forever. It&#x27;s not as if future people will ever be interested in your life. You and all records of you will just fade away. Even if you made a giant impact, soon enough, the world will be hit by an asteroid, or a plague, massive climate change, or some other great disaster. Even if we manage to avoid that, in a cosmic eyeblink, the Sun will die.<p>Nothing matters in the end, and everything will indeed end. But it&#x27;s also true that things matter for X duration of time. 
The painkiller you take when in extreme pain matters to you because it eases your pain. The warm clothes you wear in winter matter because they give you comfort.
Working on your physical health, financial condition, etc., is going to matter for the next couple of decades (the rest of your life).
All I want to say is things matter for X duration of time.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I remember hating bedtime as a kid because I could never sleep so I&#x27;d just lay there for hours every night bored out of my mind. I probably slept for about 5-6 hours on average as a kid so I was tired all the time, but on the weekends I&#x27;d get to go to bed later and sleep in to the afternoon which would give me a chance to catch back up on the sleep I lost in the week.<p>This pattern is still with me today. I&#x27;m always tired in the morning and early afternoon, but wide awake at night. It&#x27;s getting to the point now where I probably sleep around 3-4 hours on average in the week then sleep for about 10 hours on the weekends because I get to sleep all afternoon.<p>I&#x27;ve tried all the typical stuff like &quot;having a routine&quot; and avoiding blue light exposure in the evening, but it seems to do next to nothing for me.<p>I feel like every year my insomnia gets a little worse and it&#x27;s beginning to have a noticeable impact on my wellbeing and productivity at this point. For example, I&#x27;m beginning to struggle to tie sentences together and I find it hard to solve difficult technical problems.<p>I&#x27;m almost certain nothing anyone will say here will work, but I&#x27;m open to anything which might help me end this endless exhaustion.
