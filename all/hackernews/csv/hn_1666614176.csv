When I call them on Skype it very rarely rings, and you need to call them on the landline first.<p>I&#x27;d originally thought this was because of the extremely old tablet or wifi-router, but, both of those have been upgraded and the problem persists.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s just that the device is going into some kind of sleep and not notifying about an incoming call.  I have tried allowing notifications, turning off &quot;do not disturb&quot; etc.<p>Has anyone found a way around this kind of issue? Am I just doing something wrong? Is there a better app to use for calling which doesn&#x27;t have this kind of problem? Ideally I&#x27;d just like Skype to ring properly whenever the tablet is rung.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
