- Bi-directional Google calendar integration (including multiple accounts)
- Daily and weekly planning screens with extensive usage of drag&#x27;n&#x27;drop
- Time blocking for tasks 
- Different types of tasks – daily, weekly, &quot;until done&quot;
- Basic note-taking functionality<p>Also, Emery has some things we always wanted to see in other apps – private notes for meetings, group editing of overdue tasks, categories to group tasks&#x2F;notes&#x2F;meetings together, and weekly productivity reports.<p>What&#x27;s cooking:<p>- Recurring tasks

The knowledge graph consists of all the cultural things just mentioned, as well as facts about relationships between them (e.g. song P is by artist Q, who&#x27;s playing concert R, at music venue S). The social network is built around posts of items from the knowledge graph. You can reply to posts with thanks, comments, or suggestions. A suggestion features another item from the knowledge graph -- so it provides a way to say &quot;if you like X, you should check out Y&quot;. The social network uses a follow-based mechanic that will be familiar from other social apps, but it&#x27;s fully human-powered; there&#x27;s no algorithmic curation.<p>Giraf represents the use case for social media that has always appealed to me. Most people, whether they&#x27;d think of it in these terms or not, are on a lifelong journey of cultural exploration -- listening to music, reading books, watching films, going to shows, visiting places that in some way embody local culture, and so on. Giraf is meant to be a tool that serves this journey.<p>The app has been really useful among my group of friends over the last few years, for exchanging recommendations in a low-key, async way. It turns out that a dedicated tool like this can bring out a lot of fruitful communication that wouldn&#x27;t have been brought out in a group chat.<p>I&#x27;m now opening up Giraf to a wider audience. If the idea resonates with you, please check it out and give it a try! And I welcome any and all feedback here.<p>I&#x27;m committed to Giraf for the long term. My goal is to make Giraf financially viable, solely out of revenue from users who find it valuable and want to support it. To that end, I&#x27;ve built an optional, Patreon-style membership functionality [1].<p>Thanks for reading, and thanks for checking out Giraf!<p>Ian Hinsdale<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;giraf.app"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;giraf.app</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;giraf.app&#x2F;membership&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;giraf.app&#x2F;membership&#x2F;</a>",story,https://giraf.app,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

33316694,Launch HN: Noloco (YC S21) – Build internal tools from data without code,2022-10-24T13:58:57Z,darraghmckay,6,false,false,6,"[33316892,33316815,33316842]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi all, we’re Darragh and Simon, cofounders of Noloco (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noloco.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noloco.io</a>), a no-code platform for teams to create internal tools from their business data.<p>Noloco lets you create internal apps from data sources like PostgreSQL, Airtable and Google Sheets without writing any code. This makes building internal tools and configuring views a lot faster than building them with code and SQL queries. It also enables non-technical team members like those in ops, customer support or sales to make changes without having to rely on engineers.<p>Building internal tools is time-consuming and resource intensive, not just for the original build but the ongoing maintenance as well. It’s also not the kind of work that developers typically want to do, nor usually the most valuable use of their time.<p>From our prior experience at tech companies like HubSpot, TripAdvisor, Revolut and Flipdish, we experienced some of the pains around internal tooling first hand. As a PM leading the Payments team in one company, Simon would have to prepare SQL scripts every week to update customer data, and hound developers to run them. Most of the time, businesses simply didn’t have the resources to invest in updating tooling.<p>Since launching in November 2021, we have a wide variety of customers using Noloco for internal tools. For example, one real estate company is using Noloco to manage payment approvals to contractors hired across their property portfolio. An accounting firm uses Noloco as an internal practice management tool to keep track of proposals made to clients and relevant pieces of work. And a lead generation business used Noloco to build a sophisticated CRM and customer portal to track leads provided to their customers.<p>Most platforms that enable building internal tools are either targeted at developers, or are ‘low-code’ and still require some coding expertise to build something useful. Other no-code platforms typically connect to more no-code backends like Google Sheets and often focus more on B2C use cases, enabling building of publicly accessible websites, for example. Often these solutions fall short when it comes to building sophisticated internal tools around data.<p>Noloco is a fully no-code solution focused solely on web apps. We connect to relational databases like PostgreSQL as well as no-code backends like Airtable and Google Sheets, enabling companies to build powerful apps on top of their existing business data from multiple sources. We believe that we’ve got the balance right between simplicity and enhanced configuration ability for power users who want to go deep with customisation: filtering, validation rules, database permission rules etc.<p>It took us a couple of pivots to arrive at this system. Initially we were building a feature-rich full-stack website and web app builder—but no one could build anything useful with it. We decided to revamp the product to make it much simpler. A few weeks later, we had our first version of our client portal builder. This was a step in the right direction, but our value proposition around centralising customer interactions in a custom-made client portal wasn’t resonating with prospects. Finally we realized that what our most successful customers wanted was to share their existing data with their team or customers. This led us to revamp the product once more to make the focus on connecting your existing data. Once you do so, we’re able to automatically build an app around your data meaning that you can launch a whole lot faster with much less of a learning curve.<p>The starting point for building an app with Noloco is adding data. If using an external data source like Airtable or Postgres, you provide your connection details, choose what tables you want to import and then Noloco syncs your data across.  Once the initial import has finished, Noloco instantly builds an app for you around your data—including collections, forms and record pages for each database record. From there, you can customise the app and select the most appropriate layout options to display your data like tables, kanban boards, calendars and charts.<p>You can set database permissions by user role to control what records different users have access to and what fields they can view and edit. This means that you can confidently invite your team or customers and allow them to view, create and update data.<p>In case you’re interested, here’s a video of us building a Lending App from Postgres data:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CVDHCvPqgsg"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CVDHCvPqgsg</a><p>If you’re interested in trying the product, we recently launched our free tier and you get a free trial of all premium features when you sign up.

33316617,Show HN: Protect files with AES-256 encryption in your browser,2022-10-24T13:53:21Z,LMonkey,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi, my name is Ethan, and I&#x27;m the maker of ZipOne.<p>For many years, I&#x27;ve been using encryption apps and even 7-Zip to protect my important information, such as taxes, private photos, and other important paperwork. But none of these apps fully meet my needs. They are either too complicated, not usable on different platforms, or too slow. After several painful migrations between encryption apps, I decided to fix this.<p>ZipOne is an easy-to-use browser-based encryption application that offers secure, fast, cross-platform encryption. It has much built-in security functionality so that you can protect your sensitive files well with just ZipOne.<p>Select the files you want to protect or enter the information you want to encrypt. ZipOne applies AES-256 encryption to your data and locks them into an encrypted archive in seconds. Once an encrypted archive is created, you can safely save it anywhere or send it securely over the internet.<p>When you need to retrieve files from an encrypted archive, you can quickly preview the archive&#x27;s contents without first decrypting the entire contents of the archive to the device, and you can retrieve only the files you need.<p>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that ZipOne doesn&#x27;t directly use your password as an encryption key to encrypt data. ZipOne uses a hybrid cryptosystem, similar to how some password management apps work but different from most file encryption apps. This makes ZipOne easy enough to use without sacrificing security. Thanks to hybrid encryption,  you can change your password anytime without re-encrypting previously encrypted files, or you can share encrypted data with others without sharing a common password.<p>Try it out, and send me any feedback.",story,https://zipone.app,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
