Firefox is a great browser, and my #1 choice.<p>However over the past 2-3 months I&#x27;ve noticed that the frequency of updates has increased. Most of these updates are of minimal impact, and in sem-ver language, are often patch releases.<p>While that is good and all, I, for the most part, don&#x27;t want (or need) to update Firefox every time there&#x27;s a bugfix that (most of the time) doesn&#x27;t even apply to me. As an example, this morning I was prompted to install 106.0.1 (from my current 106.0) because of a single bugfix that affects users with AMD Zen 1 CPU&#x27;s. I am on an M1 Mac. So yes, downloading a ~100MB update would be 1) unnecessary 2) wasteful, regardless of how little 100MB is in today&#x27;s perspective (imagine how much that would be in 2003).<p>Yes, updates have gotten cheaper as compute and storage has increased over the years. But still, they all involve ~100MB each time, and in my opinion are somewhat abused in modern development cycles. Nobody except the Nightly crowd really cares about getting updates for each and every commit.<p>I acknowledge that this has become a problem with most software in general, but that is an issue to tackle another day.
