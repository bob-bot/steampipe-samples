I have a client that wants to use Shopify and also wants to use their current processor.<p>I can&#x27;t get a straight answer from support.<p>Assume Advanced package for pricing.
If someone uses a 3rd party processor does shopify apply their flat rate fee on top of the 3rd party fee?<p>The answer I got from support was yes they do. But this doesn&#x27;t make sense because the 3rd party gateway would be tied to the processor which would apply their own fees and shopify is simply charging a fee of 0.5% to do that.<p>Online Canadian credit card rates -&quot;2.4% + 30¢ CAD&quot; ( this is a Flat rate Processing fee that shopify is passing on from their processor on to the store)<p>&quot;3rd party fees on transactions not processed through Shopify Payments&quot; - 0.5%<p>I can get my client cost + 0.05% which is still way cheaper with the  0.5% shopify fee.<p>So would my client be charged 2.4% + 30 cents + 0.5% + (processor cost) + 0.05% ?<p>If so this would be absurd.<p>Thank you.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
