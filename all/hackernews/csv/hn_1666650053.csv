Very often I seem to struggle to get anything done when I’m working on an unfamiliar subject, specially when I struggle with the documentation. This is not a rant about bad documentation, but an attempt to learn about some stories and strategies from people that can always seem to get things done even in a situation where the documentation isn’t for total beginners and they don’t also have the correct background.<p>A good example is Prometheus. I struggle with their documentation, but I feel I’m missing some background knowledge as well, but I don’t even know where to get it.<p>Another one is AWS. I’ve tried to use AWS ECS with an EC2 launcher but I failed to do it by myself. I later found a GitHub example, but I really don’t know what I’m doing.<p>How do you get your work done in these situations (let’s assume the final answer is not just a couple of Google searches away)? Do you just go down the rabbit whole of whatever seems to be the required background knowledge? Is it trial-an-error? If so, how do you it’s done right and you’re not overlooking anything major when you don’t understand all the variables involved in the problem?<p>I hope this question isn’t too vague and you’re able to understand the kind of advice I’m chasing.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The startup deals with weather and offers the clients an API. The Tech stack is Python in the back end and React&#x2F;Angular in the frontend. 
Language is english thus international. 
3 days home office.
The SME on the other hand has legacy code to deal with based on java and vaadin at one division or php and vue on the other. 
It&#x27;s at minimum 1 day home office but I got told! that it could be 2 or 3 after three months in. 
The spoken language is local to the country thus not international and the company is well known. 
I&#x27;ve already met the people at the SME when I made a visit for a day. 
Both pay the same.
Now I&#x27;m asking myself whether I should start at a well known company with legacy code and boring tech and less home office available but nice perks like food and atmosphere or should I work at interesting tech at the startup with vibey people and more home office available? 
What leads to a better career path and where could I potentially specialize further?
I was told at the startup interview that I have to be prepared to do a lot of context switching. 
Also I got diagnosed with ADD and I&#x27;m a little bit socially anxious.<p>Thanks for reading all this. Sorry for my english.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This free mobile application helps you take a shorter shower by keeping you focused. This is done with routines comprised of activities (shampoo hair, wash body, etc). When the routine is started, the app will tell you which activity you should be doing. Download the application and let me know what you think. Always looking for feedback. Thanks!!<p>Please up vote on Product Hunt:
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;shorter-shower"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;shorter-shower</a><p>Longer version:<p>My brothers and I took after my father in a lot of ways. One of the biggest was taking very long showers. When I moved to California, it was frowned upon to take a long shower due to it wasting water. I tried to take shorter showers but I kept zoning out. All of a sudden, 5-10 mins went by and I hadn&#x27;t done anything yet.<p>To solve this I tried setting timers, counting to myself, and a number of other ways. I realized the only way that I could consistently take a shorter shower is if something told me what I was supposed to be doing. That is when I created shorter shower. The app allows you to create activities (shampoo hair, wash body, etc) with an expected duration. You can combine the activities into multiple timers&#x2F;routines. When you start the timer, it will change the volume of your phone to a predefined value so you can hear it over the shower noise. It will then audibly tell you what you should be doing when. It will stop the timer automatically when you are on the last activity and you turn off the shower. When the timer is done, the phone volume will be reset to its previous value. This app helped me go from 12 min showers to 5 min showers very quickly.<p>A few notes about data. Activity and timer data is stored on the phone. I send water usage metrics to a server but do not include user information. This is mainly to answer the question, how much water are people saving &#x2F; using each day. I also use GA to track user interactions.",story,https://shortershower.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
