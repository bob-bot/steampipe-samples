We are super excited to show you what we’ve been building. Circl is a brain-sensing headset that tracks your brain performance to help you improve it.<p>The Problem — Our brain is not included in our understanding and measurement of human health and performance. Therefore, it is often taken for granted and we burn out, get brain fog, and live with brain health conditions.<p>Our Solution — We have built a headset and app that allows you to track your brain performance daily with a simple 5 min test. This test has been refined over the last 60 years in academic neuroscience research labs, and we are bringing it to the world so that we can all benefit from it. It is the most accurate way to track your cognitive ability. 
1. Build a baseline of your cognitive performance
2. Track the effectiveness of your sleep and rest
3. Track how exhausting your work is
4. Identify broader brain health trends that may lead to burn out or brain fog<p><pre><code>  Our ask — Tell us what you think</code></pre>

While some use-cases definitely required improvements (e.g. deep learning became a thing thanks to powerful hardware), it is not clear that all software is better now that &quot;RAM&#x2F;CPU is cheap&quot;. For instance, IRC predates the World Wide Web, but desktop apps like Slack&#x2F;Discord (that get shipped with a whole browser with ElectronJS) solve the exact same problem. Many websites are excessively heavy, &quot;because they can&quot;, I guess mostly to &quot;look better&quot;, and maybe to some extent because of ads&#x2F;trackers. Modern developer tools require to download half the Internet regularly (e.g. node projects often come with 30 000 dependencies, apps get shipped with a whole rootfs in containers, or with an embedded chromium browser, etc). There is a ton of overhead everywhere, sometimes just because we can, sometimes because it&#x27;s faster to market.<p>So I was wondering: how do you think software would look today if hardware had stopped improving, say 10 or 20 years ago? Surely we would have end-to-end messaging apps and social networks, but maybe video-on-demand (e.g. Netflix) would be more limited, and we would not have TikTok? Maybe we would not need 5G to connect our fridges to our shoes? We would not have cryptocurrencies or NFTs. But that does not mean we would have stopped developing software.<p>Or maybe said differently: what are &quot;useless&#x2F;cosmetic&quot; improvements that happened in the last 10 or 20 years in software, and what are &quot;real&quot; ones?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
