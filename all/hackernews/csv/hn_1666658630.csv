AKA I feel dumber, however this feeling is a little different to my experience with brain fog as with brain fog I can feel the ability to &quot;think&quot; at a higher level &quot;there&quot; but it is just covered by the fog sensation, this time I feel dumber, and I can never achieve that higher level of cognitive thought. I am also doing worse academically as a result.<p>I have read my that brain matter density has potentially decreased, and I cannot reverse this feeling and me being dumber, however I have also read that my brain cells are inflamed and it is short term and is reversible.<p>I thought HN would be a good place to ask since a lot of people on here seem to know about biology and anatomy etc and I didn&#x27;t want to make a doctor&#x27;s appointment if it was a short term thing - Edit: Apparently 4chan&#x2F;pol would be a better place to post this",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
