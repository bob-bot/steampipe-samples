I live in a country where I don&#x27;t really have to worry about taxes and work permits and such. I am currently a full employee, not a contractor.<p>In a few years, I&#x27;d like to live and work in France for the same company, if possible. They are already international, but there is no official France or EU registration.<p>I&#x27;d consider switching to contracting if that made it possible to live in France. Is anyone here doing it, or do you know if that would be allowed by France? I want to do it all legally and pay the correct taxes.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that my company will not have any issues with where I am located and will leave legalities up to me.<p>It&#x27;s also possible the company would incorporate a French office if I could handle it all for them. Is that any easier than registering as a contractor?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

33326533,What's the next evolution of GUI OS?,2022-10-25T05:20:09Z,berkimbayev,2,false,false,2,"[33326655,33326586]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi, in the past few years I was thinking about the evolution of OS based on GUI. Right now, we have all these windows and menus and lists. And you&#x27;ve probably noticed there is some uncomfortable limitation. For example, when you&#x27;re working on some complex task, you can rarely feel the process flowing. You need to open different windows or different programs and go back and forth between them, spending time and mental resources. What can be a better solution to this?<p>What if we remove windows completely? Think about it - when you open a program, you don&#x27;t actually need a separate window. What you need is functionality! So what if we remove windows and keep only the functionality. For example, you open a .doc file, but there is no separate window. You stay in the same &quot;Desktop&quot;, but now you have an open file and functions to work with this file. And if you need some other functions, you open another program - and other functions appear on the desktop. So now you have two different programs working as one! And you don&#x27;t need to arrange different programs and files on the screen. Because now you can have different programs and files working simultaneously as one.<p>I think that will be an incredible experience! And it will tremendously increase productivity and improve the workflow. If you&#x27;re interested or have a comment, let&#x27;s discuss below.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
