33327004,Ask HN: How to fund personal CS research if you are from Russia?,2022-10-25T06:35:52Z,Eliah_Lakhin,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Dear Hacker News,<p>A friend of mine who is from Russia is currently in somewhat unusual situation. He asked me to give him advice, but I don&#x27;t know what to tell him, and I would like to ask for your opinion too.<p>My friend is a very talented person, who has been working on computer science research in quite rare fields of research for many years.<p>He is a self-taught one, he never received formal education, but he has deep knowledge and expertise in these fields. To fund his personal project and to pay regular bills, he is working as a mobile app developer. So, his research is basically a &quot;hobby&quot; thing, but he sees it as his primary life priority. To mention, he does not have any family. So, his side work is basically all that he has.<p>Recently my friend has to leave his job and to escape Russia, because he does not want to participate in Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Currently he lives abroad in those few countries that still didn&#x27;t close their borders to Russian citizens. Informally speaking he is a refugee, even though he does not have such status officially. It is likely that if he returns back home he will be prescribed to serve in the war zone.<p>Hear is the problem.<p>He wants to keep working on his research project, but his savings are declining dramatically, because he lives abroad. He is going to find remote job to pay current expenses, but probably he no longer will be able to continue his research in this case. He will have to survive.<p>I really don&#x27;t know what to tell him. In some way his situation is much better than a lot of people have today. At least he could find a job, and he has some savings. But he will have to abandon the work of his life.<p>Maybe there are another opportunities I could advice him in his situation?<p>Thanks in advance!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We&#x27;d often bonded over Paul Graham&#x27;s &quot;Do Things That Don&#x27;t Scale&quot;, so it was a no-brainer that every month, like clockwork, we&#x27;d get on that €50 Ryanair flight to London, to spend a week pitching potential customers &#x2F; partners &#x2F; anyone who would listen.  We tried as best we could to rotate which lucky friend or family members&#x27; sofa we would be sleeping on each time, so as not to out-stay our welcome.<p>One event that we ended up doing again and again was called TechHub Tuesday Demo Night.  It was an epic monthly event (first Tuesday of every month) hosted by the most sought after startup co-working space on London&#x27;s famous &quot;Silicon Roundabout&quot; (yes, us English can&#x27;t quite fill a valley yet with our startup scene, but we sure can fill a roundabout!).  The event was an opportunity for up-and-coming startups to show (not tell) what they had built, and get instant feedback from the community.  Importantly, you had to have built something (an app &#x2F; website &#x2F; platform &#x2F; etc.) and, unlike competing events, it wasn&#x27;t about trying to pitch for investment.  It was a welcoming, enthusiastic audience of fellow entrepreneurs, builders and product lovers.  Pitching your product here was always a buzz.<p>Unfortunately, like many other great ventures, TechHub London was one of the unlucky victims of Covid 19.  In the summer of 2020 they slipped into administration, and with it TechHub Tuesday Demo Night.  We&#x27;ve very much missed it - both presenting and attending - so we have decided to do something about it.<p>We are pumped to announce that next Tuesday we are launching our very own Tuesday Demo Day with a twist:<p>- it will be 100% virtual,
- and 100% free.<p>This means that you can join us from the comfort of your couch.  Bring a beverage of your choice and be ready to be give our startups the feedback and advice they need to take themselves to the next level.<p>We would be absolutely delighted if you would join us (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hopin.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;trevor-demo-day).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
