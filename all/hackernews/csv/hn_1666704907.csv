Here&#x27;s what most people do –<p>- Send it to someone on WhatsApp or other messaging service.
- Email it to themselves.
- Use a note taking application like Google Keep, Apple Notes or OneNote (my preferred way until now).<p>All of these require you to already have those services logged into on both the devices. Logging into any service on a new device these days is a tedious process involving 2-factor authentication. What if there was a quick way to share data between devices? One that did not require any logins or installing any apps?<p>Starting with this thought, I built Klipit.in. An online clipboard to share data quickly between devices.<p>You get an instant online clipboard with a unique link. No need to create any account. You can paste any data to this clipboard and simply open the link on another device. Nothing to install, no logins required. Quick and easy. There is also a QR code which you can scan to open the clipboard in browser.<p>Some features that I may add depending on how it takes off -<p>- Password protection
- Real time refresh
- Sharing files
- Klipit account with multiple clipboards
- Custom clipboard URL<p>Play with it and let me know what you think.",story,https://klipit.in/fcw-52937,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;d really appreciate an opportunity to align with others. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s objectively true reading through so many opinions online, sometimes I even start to doubt my own ability to reason. Indulge me if you would, forgive me if you won&#x27;t.<p>Reasons why racism is a bad thing:<p>- &quot;Race&quot; is not a precise attribute, it could not be used as a precise metric.<p>Because &quot;race&quot; is not well-defined, conclusions drawn about members of a &quot;race&quot; are not going to be precise or accurate. At worst, you might find a correlation and assume it to be a causation, at which point you&#x27;re creating tangible effects of racism. Don&#x27;t be that person.<p>- &quot;Race&quot; of an individual does not determine that individual&#x27;s choices.<p>This is the classic notion to &quot;judge not by the color of the skin, but by the content of the character.&quot; Why should we do this? Justice demands that we be held accountable for the choices we make and be free of accountability from choices that are not ours to make.<p>Then again, is it really possible to determine the &quot;true cause&quot; of any given event? Are all events &quot;caused&quot; to some degree by the Big Bang? Do we have free will? Are we living in a physics simulation?<p>Not reasons why racism is a bad thing:<p>- &quot;Equality&quot;: equality is an impossibility.<p>Even among people of the same &quot;race&quot; the distribution of characteristics that create prosperity is very uneven. Much of the discussion is centered around notions of Equality &#x2F; Equity yet I rarely if ever seen any discussion of the precise definition of equality with respect to (e.g.) adult Americans. I assume this is because taken literally it would of course be impossible for two people to be literally equal. Would love to hear some enlightened discussion of what it means to be equal and whether or not it would be a good thing for all people to be &quot;equal&quot; and whether the ends would justify the means of making it happen<p>- &quot;Diversity&quot;: there is no value in superficial diversity.<p>Diversity, as commonly used in pop media, is nothing more than a euphemism for strange racial fetishes. You can see in some places online there are remnants of the original, logical thought behind the push for diversity: &quot;Diversity of opinion and thought...&quot; Why is this kind of diversity a good thing? It helps us make better decisions by helping to prevent cognitive biases.<p>Diversity of the color of the skin of employees is not meaningful diversity, especially when everyone you hire agrees with you.<p>- &quot;Fairness&quot;: fairness is a social construct, society is global and asynchronous.<p>Go far enough back in history and humans cease to exist. Who decides where we start when considering what&#x27;s fair? Which culture&#x27;s system of values do we use along the way while balancing the scales of justice? What is the exact ranking of the forms of suffering?<p>- &quot;Personal Preference&quot;: you and I are on the same page here, sometimes I take actions without any further reasoning than &quot;I feel like it&quot; and racism being bad is one of those notions for which I just simply don&#x27;t need any further reasoning.<p>However, I think it&#x27;s important to understand that personal preference has absolutely zero influence on objective truth. It&#x27;s important to keep personal preferences out of discussions of truth and justice lest we devolve into simple hand-to-hand combat as we have for thousands of years. There is no justification for forcing one&#x27;s personal preferences on another. Focus on the real, objective reasons that stand behind your personal preferences, there&#x27;s always something there if you consider it deeply enough.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It might be another VCs’ pendulum symptom, or might not.<p>Our point is: <i>full usage-based pricing</i> (like Snowflake) has some limits: 
* For the <i>merchant</i>:
- Cash collection challenges:  it might be hard to collect revenue <i>after</i> the consumption: the client may dispute the bill, or never pay it
- Revenue predictability: full usage-based pricing means revenue is less predictable, all the notions or MRR&#x2F;ARR and corresponding SaaS metrics are obsolete
* For the <i>customer</i>: they have no peace of mind around cost, and may be anxious around an upcoming bill<p>That’s why an increasing number of companies are using <i>pre-paid credits</i> for their pricing: 
* For the <i>merchant</i>: cash is collected beforehand, credits create a layer of abstraction that enables them to iterate on pricing 
* For the <i>customer</i>: they have more peace of mind on how much money is going to be spent (-&gt; budget), and they can ‘lock’ a specific pricing by prepaying an amount of credits.<p>Such system has <i>2 major limits</i> though : 
1&#x2F; For customers: buying credits can seem a bit ‘obscure’&#x2F;less understandable 
2&#x2F; For merchants: a credit system implies building a wallet and managing its balance as part of the billing system.<p>Regarding 2&#x2F; We’ve open sourced our API (which also has a UI for non-tech users) and it now enables you to build a ‘prepaid billing system’: 
a&#x2F; Create wallets for your customers
Set the credit value, the number of free credits, the expiration dateetc.
b&#x2F; Manage credit purchases and top-ups 
c&#x2F; Invoice your users<p>Doc here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.getlago.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guide&#x2F;prepaid_credits#credit-purchases-and-top-ups

Back-end: Ruby 
Front-end: ReactJS, GraphQL -&gt; no need to be technical to use Lago 
API clients: Curl, Python, Ruby, Node.js, Go<p>—
PS: another use case of credits is to incentivize users to perform an action. 
E.g., it can be used as a reward if your user refers a new user. Notion uses it to incentivize their users to try out new features and use their app across devices.

33330050,Ask HN: Do you see there being a future job role for generating AI prompts?,2022-10-25T13:16:08Z,aliqot,1,false,false,<null>,[33330157],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I wonder sometimes if the tastemakers of the future will be prompt-engineers.<p>Let&#x27;s use Netflix as an example: my assumption is right now the majority non-personnel costs for netflix are licensing, production, and network-related costs. In the future, I could see them using the same infrastructure to generate bespoke series and movies for user&#x27;s prompts. In the ToS it will specify the product of those prompts belongs to Netflix, and the users will trade and show off their prompts with friends on Netflix&#x27;s social interface. This eliminates a lot of the cost in focus grouping, casting, actors, editors, production, licensing, royalties if any.<p>In the new AI netflix, new tastemakers emerge, people who are known for having the best prompts, and with 0 cost of licensing or production Netflix has a never ending stream of -exactly- what the users want. Knowledge of what the user wants to see is a big part of what Netflix is concerned about in this current day.<p>So, with this example in mind, I go between two extremes: 1) this will be a job for talented few, like being an actor now, making prompts will be a niche or a <i>cause-célebre</i>, 2) this will be something everyone does, like taking beautiful photos&#x2F;videos on your consumer camera.<p>What do you think, will this be a job some day or will this just be something that everyone &#x27;does&#x27; to get a better output from their AI &#x27;helpers&#x27;?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
