    - One of the owners (he has a huge amount of shares) explicitly told me I will never get a raise, because contractors don&#x27;t get raises.

    - I have a manager that even micromanages my work and keep pestering me whenever I don&#x27;t reply promptly, can&#x27;t even go to the bathroom without my phone without this guy noticing.
    - I got a semi-leadership position, I don&#x27;t have any employees under me but there is a project in the company that I own completely and make all decisions, and whenever someone else screws up on that project I am responsible (even if they don&#x27;t report to me directly).
    - Whenever a project is late, I have to help and work unpaid overtime (in fact I worked the past months 12+ hour per day including weekends, also having zoom calls with clients 4:00 in the morning is a thing that happened).

Other employees been quitting for a while now, company has very high turnover, including losing lead engineers that didn&#x27;t document their work so many new employees have no idea how the company tech actually works.<p>Also the jurisdiction of my contract is UK, but I don&#x27;t live in UK, and I am not UK citizen, I am not sure if I even can sue them, or if I was going to sue them, what kind of lawyer I would have to look for.<p>Contract is full of sketchy stuff, like they owning even my personal diary if I wrote in it during my contract, or owning my private correspondence.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;ve recently reflected on the negative impact most web images have on my daily quality of life.

Think about the sheer amount of visual stimuli you&#x27;re exposing yourself in only one hour. Of course, most of this content is designed to hijack your emotions in some way. I had my last straw when I was scrolling through a safe-for-work page on movies and I caught a glipmse of a gruesome still from a horror flick. It might sound like a minor nuisance but it soured my whole day. That&#x27;s when I decided to block all images on the browser by default. If I want to view any specific page I have to explicitly give it my permission by putting it on the browser whitelist.<p>It squares nicely with my other blockers (e.g. all the suggestions&#x2F;recommended videos from YouTube and the sidebar from most websites) to convey a nicer, smoother browsing experience. I feel silly for never using this feature until now.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
