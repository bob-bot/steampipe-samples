We both received the vaccine at the exact same time in 2021. However, she proceeded to get her boosters including the latest while I did not. We are both healthy young adults with normal BMI. We took the same supplements: daily vitamin, fish oil. We ate the same food. We shared the same space.<p>Note there are known discrepancies between males and females[0], so treat this anecdata as anecdata.<p>Recently, my brother--who was vaccinated and had COVID (delta) once before but no booster--visited while he was floridly positive. By floridly positive, I mean he was able to trigger a rapid test.<p>After 3 days of exposure, both my partner and I developed COVID that was only detectable by PCR.<p>On day 4, I developed a high fever (102), soar throat, cough, congestion. I was then shedding enough virus to trigger a rapid test. My brothers symptoms resolved, he no longer triggered a rapid test. My partner did not have any symptoms or trigger a rapid test. I took an Advil.<p>On day 5, my fever continued although more mildly, soar throat, cough, congestion continued. I was still able to trigger a raid test. My partner complained of a scratchy throat but did not trigger a rapid test.<p>On day 6, I no longer had a fever only a mild sore throat and congestion. I was able to trigger a rapid test. My partner did not have any symptoms or trigger a rapid test.<p>It&#x27;s day 7, my symptoms have resolved and I was no longer able to trigger a rapid test. My partner? You guessed it: nada.<p>Note, my partner continued to cohabit with me through this period as if nothing was different. We shared the same bed, we shared the same cups, she give me kisses--you know everything you&#x27;re absolutely not supposed to do when you&#x27;re with someone who has COVID, but she never shed enough virus to trigger a rapid test and never developed symptoms of note.<p>Conclusion: Boosters appear to reduce or even eliminate COVID symptoms. Boosters also appear to reduce virus shedding as evidenced by the rapid test results.<p>Disclaimer: There&#x27;s apparently some risk that the virus mutates in one person and reinfects the other. So maybe don&#x27;t try this at home?<p>[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7381128&#x2F;",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
