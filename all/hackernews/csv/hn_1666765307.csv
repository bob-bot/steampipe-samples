Here’s what it does:<p>According to research, 20 to 50 percent high school students go to college with no knowledge of what they should study. 75 percent of these students change their major more than once. I want to develop an app where college and high school students can get the guidance and assistance to help determine where their interests lie. The app will offer subscriptions and access to career&#x2F;educational counselors from various backgrounds and professions, who will help these students decipher their abilities (through a detailed set of questions) and match them with majors best suited for them.<p>What do you think? Is it feasible?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
