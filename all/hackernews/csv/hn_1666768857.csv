to canonical forms. Application of these laws improved circuit design forever.<p>My question: Can &quot;Irrelevance Laws&quot; be developed in proofs so one style
of proof can be mechanically converted to another style? If so, can a system
like LEAN convert the library to canonical forms?<p>Canonical forms of proof, if they exist, and if they have the proper form,
would make it possible to develop &quot;proof compilers&quot; that could generate
code from (constructive) proofs. (See Ording 28, p65, of special interest).<p>Is there any reason to believe canonical forms exist? I know that judgment
towers can be expanded in various ways. Perhaps there is a mechanical
theory to put (some of) the LEAN library in &quot;canonical form&quot;.<p>Beside the book, is there any known collection of proof transformation?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Throughout that time I always kept an eye on the job market so I could stay in the loop and better gauge what my prospects would be to go back into work later, not least because of the economic turmoil.<p>However, I got immensely frustrated with existing job boards advertising software developer jobs. I didn&#x27;t feel like they included a lot of information which engineers actually care about or even basic things like a salary range. Additionally I observed discussions on HN how increasingly more software engineers say they wouldn&#x27;t want to work for a company anymore if they use technology X or Y. With that in mind I created Keyboard Jobs and launched it a few weeks ago.<p>So far I&#x27;ve been mostly talking friends at former companies I&#x27;ve worked with or sent cold emails with 100% discounted voucher codes to get the first jobs listed. It&#x27;s been moderately successful but I am ready to gather more feedback on what hackers would love to see from a job board made for them!",story,https://keyboardjobs.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
