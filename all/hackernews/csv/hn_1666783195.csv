For some people these are side-projects. 
However, being a non-developer makes the process rather lengthy and tedious.
I have tried and built web-apps with no-code tools and also learnt web development on Flask (thanks to CS50!), however the learning curve was rather time consuming.
You end up consuming a lot of time just to learn the language&#x2F;tool itself before you can actually build the product, tinker with features, get customer feedback etc.<p>Are there forums out there where I could find and team up with developers to build such product MVPs faster &amp; validate my ideas? Basically like a tech co-founder (but not in a startup). Or is there some other way I am missing?<p>Suggestions welcome
Thanks!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Javascript provides an enormous variety of dimensions, and probably the only way that two different humans have the same fingerprint is if they have both just bought a new device and did not deviate from the stock configuration, in which case scroll behavior or similar telemetry profiling probably can differentiate between them.<p>As a consequence of dropping Javascript by default, I also have been pleasently surprised by how much data I save browsing, how my battery life improved, and how usable the internet is without Javascript (and ads).<p>Have you had a similar experience?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
