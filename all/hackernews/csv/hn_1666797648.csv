Task&#x2F;Test requests comes in asynchronously
2. Each request have a list of needed resources, for example a CPU, OS, Platform, Version of something or data availability
3. A manager has a list of agents (an agent can be physical, virtual or local) with their available resources and status
4. The manager allocate an agent and mark it as in-use
5. The manager waits for completion, collects the execution results (probably asynchronously) and marks the agent as not in use<p>It&#x27;s not overly complicated to build one yourself but as always it&#x27;s best to use something generic and tested. CI systems can be used to solve the problem but it&#x27;s over engineering and complicates execution from a single point.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33343420
