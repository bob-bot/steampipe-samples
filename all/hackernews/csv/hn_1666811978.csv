The startup Tech stack is Python in the back end and React&#x2F;Angular in the frontend. Language is english thus international. 3 days home office. The SME on the other hand has legacy code to deal with based on old stack. It&#x27;s at minimum 1 day home office but I got told! that it could be 2 or 3 after three months in. The spoken language is local to the country thus not international and the company is well known. I&#x27;ve already met the people at the SME when I made a visit for a day. Both pay the same. Now I&#x27;m asking myself whether I should start at a well known company with legacy code and boring tech and less home office available but nice perks like food and atmosphere or should I work at interesting tech at the startup with vibey people and more home office available? What leads to a better career path and where could I potentially specialize further? I was told at the startup interview that I have to be prepared to do a lot of context switching. Also I got diagnosed with ADD and I&#x27;m a little bit socially anxious.<p>Thanks for reading all this. Sorry for my english.,story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
