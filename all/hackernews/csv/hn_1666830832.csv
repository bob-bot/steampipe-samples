In fact I wanted to share a pitch deck on Reddit but I&#x27;m afraid someone could copy it. Of course a project shouldn&#x27;t be so easy to copy but that thought is right for the final app.
For a UX&#x2F;UI designer it shouldn&#x27;t take a lot to build an MVP or just a mock up with Figma.
I&#x27;m just a regular person that had an idea which I believe is a bit of a game-changer.
Is this a safe place to share a project?<p>Sorry if I sound a bit arrogant or stupid but I really care about this idea, it&#x27;s like a child, you know?
Feel free to give any advice or whatsoever.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
