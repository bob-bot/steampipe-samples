Since my last posts, I&#x27;ve added:<p><pre><code>   - free trial with *no signup* required
   - improved quality of the model and results.
   - improved usability.
</code></pre>
Example usage:
if you query for &quot;being home at night watching Netflix on the couch&quot;, results can contain &quot;relaxing&quot; and &quot;unwinding&quot; but also &quot;binge-watching&quot; since I mentioned Netflix. Bonus points when I get some slang in the results (e.g. couch-potatoing).<p>Remember: (i) the more detailed your query is, the better and (ii) phraisely is creative so try to run a query multiple times.<p>I&#x27;m planning to keep working improving the model and the results.
Comments and suggestions are welcome. Thank you.",story,https://phraisely.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
