I have a lot of experience coding, and would even say I am a pretty good software dev for being in academia. That said, I recently got a day job to help ease the cost of running the startup (we&#x27;d rather wait till next year to raise a round).<p>So I was hired by a hardware company to help them automate their testing infrastructure. My manager is in charge of the the automation group, but he has more of a hardware background and is better with coding than the other hardware people, but it isnt his specialty, so a lot of the responsibility to adopt good software development principals is mine, but the last time I really had any kind of exposure to a ticketing system or testing philosophy was my first 2 years out of undergrad and that was a while ago, but even then I remember it being much more organized than what we have currently.<p>Could you point me to resources for best practices for these sorts of things?

I get a call at 5am Eastern Time (I guess did say &quot;the morning&quot; was a good time to call...) from Google confirming this, and that they need to check back with their team.
