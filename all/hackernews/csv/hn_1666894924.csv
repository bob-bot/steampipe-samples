    • Sure, a real email address would get spammed, but let me kick it off from a contact page and then reply via email
    • Let me upload files and screenshots
    • This is asking a lot, but basic formatting for quotes or pre blocks for logs makes a world of difference
  • Let me navigate the phone tree on the web and have them call me when a representative is available instead of me waiting
    • Or at least give specific numbers on a web page so I can bypass the phone tree
  • Provide visibility into the underlying ticketing system.
    • If a customer support agent is typing up notes, let me see them. Send them in an email so I can search the text and pull up the ticket number for instance.
