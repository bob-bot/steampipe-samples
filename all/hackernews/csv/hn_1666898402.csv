I had a lot of fun putting myself into different universes (Apollo 11, Hulk, Wild West, Dr Strange) using Dreambooth and Stable Diffusion. I&#x27;m curious to see if there is an appetite for this type of entertainment app.<p>My vision is pre-configured prompts and pre-generating images, so people can explore it like a selfieverse feed. For technical users, I would offer them to download the 2GB model so that can own it and run their own prompts. Long term, maybe open up the prompt UI for technical users.<p>Another goal was to re-learn Rust. This UI is built in Yew (Rust, CSS, and HTML only) and the backend is in Actix. It has been a great practical project for getting practice with the language.<p>Thank you for the feedback!",story,https://anyselfie.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
