For example, I was hiking with a friend the other day who has an S22 and he snapped a gorgeous photo from the top of the hill. But something seemed off with the clouds - it shaped slightly, but surely, different than what I observed with my naked eyes. It&#x27;s like being in an uncanny valley.<p>Also, most photos that I see people take with their phones have the saturation way too intense than in real life. I believe they are taking HDR photos but the auto-balancing act of the HDR tones is just not quite right. 
Same goes for the blurring effect. The depth of field achieved by phones are so artificial and unnatural that it throws me off a lot. It just flattens everything behind the subject and gives the same amount of blur. But depth of field doesn&#x27;t work like that in real life!<p>Phones&#x27; default behavior should be to capture the photo as true to real life as possible and then maybe if the user wants to be creative, then reveal all the tools.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
