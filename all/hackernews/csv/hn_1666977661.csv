33373818,Launching Rentaflop – Render your Blender projects without sacrificing quality,2022-10-28T16:40:26Z,dasokol112358,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN,
My name is David Sokol, and I&#x27;m the founder of rentaflop (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rentaflop.com). We&#x27;re a crowdsourced render farm aimed at making Blender rendering fast and affordable.<p>If you&#x27;ve used Blender, then I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve experienced the pain of waiting around for your animations to render. You&#x27;ve probably even had to sacrifice the quality of your work to reduce your render times. I&#x27;ve been there too.<p>Our solution to this dilemma is to leverage low opportunity cost hardware from around the world to allow Blender artists to render their projects quickly, affordably, and without compromising on quality. When artists need to create an animation, instead of lowering the quality of their work to reduce render times or paying thousands to buy or rent the hardware required, they can get fast and affordable rendering without compromising on quality.<p>We just wrapped up our beta and are now launching to the public! If you&#x27;d like to try us, check out our site (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rentaflop.com) and render your Blender project quickly and affordably!<p>We posted about our beta on HN a few weeks ago. If you&#x27;d like, you can check out the discussion here (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=32838673). These are some of the features we&#x27;ve added since last time:
1. Price calculator, allowing you to see exactly what you&#x27;ll pay for a render and view sample frames to verify render correctness.
2. Blender versioned rendering, so you can choose from among several different Blender versions to render your project with.
3. File upload size limit raised to 1 GB, so you can now upload much larger projects than before.
4. Encrypted .blend files, giving you enhanced data privacy and protecting your IP during the rendering process.<p>Please leave a comment below, we&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts :)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
