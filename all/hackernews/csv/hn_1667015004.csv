In all sorts of different ways, something stops hard problems from having efficient solutions.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scottaaronson.blog&#x2F;?p=1720<p>I know someone who used to work on QC and they said offhand “Maybe building a large quantum computer will be just as hard as solving hard computational problems.” Aka, maybe the invisible fence is there for QC too.<p>I also know that due to the way QC affects cryptography, it gets a lot of funding from governments. It’s an arms race. This could produce a lot of business, without actual results.<p>So I want to hear from a quantum computing researcher.
