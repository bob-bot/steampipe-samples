We just moved back into our building after a year-long renovation, and one of our rooms -- currently piled high with junk -- is to be remodeled into a seminar room. I&#x27;m on the committee that will make recommendations as to what to do.<p>The room will host: formal seminar presentations (some using a chalkboard; others with PowerPoints); informal math discussions and study groups; various committee meetings; perhaps other things too.<p>Traditionally everything has been in-person, and for the most part academia is back to in-person. But, since we&#x27;re planning for the future, we want to make sure that we can accommodate hybrid in-person&#x2F;online meetings, online presentations where an audience can hear and see someone at the chalkboard, ... whatever use cases might arise in the future.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m the best choice for this committee -- I&#x27;m something of a luddite and I don&#x27;t personally like remote meetings. But I&#x27;ve been asked to serve, and I want to make sure I do a good job of planning for the future and anticipating the diverse needs of the department.<p>Any advice as I go about this? Examples of successful designs (in any setting) that I can read about? Discussions and reviews of various technological solutions? Anything else?<p>Thank you!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
