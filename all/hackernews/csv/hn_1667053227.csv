As an introvert it often occurred to me to spend a week before answering an email, or spend hours to answer a random discord conv, this is the kind of helpful use-cases we are aiming for.<p>I know HN is usually interested in more technical topics, but any raw feedback is appreciated :) The website is built with React&#x2F;Tailwind on the frontend and Rust for the backend",story,https://conv911.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Example is my elder mother, the sweetest person you met, but trolls and clowns on Twitter that she constantly engage with turn her into someone I never knew I would experience. Its very sad.<p>Now personally I am the calmest person you witness, but it takes less than 5 minutes of twitter scrolling to get me engaged with some idiot being wrong. Sometimes its a conversation that I follow and that conversation triggers me and I need to join wasting time and being angry. But not anymore! Just few months ago, in response to someone calling me bold (actually random avatar, far from bold&#x2F;ing), I called them fat - apparently something that is on Twitter ban list, and my account got switched into &quot;read only&quot; mode. I could refresh and read newest content, but not follow or reply&#x2F;tweet. Obviously I immediately went into wanting to appeal that decision... but then I realized - &quot;let me try to use Twitter like this.&quot; And oh boy let me tell you how wonderful my experience is! Sometimes I still get to read idiots and nasty people&#x27;s comments... but my own awareness that I cannot simply join them and waste my time and get myself angry, that blessing is simply worth $99 that I would otherwise gladly pay Twitter each and every month to have this blessing of a &quot;read only&quot; Twitter account.<p>End of the story.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
