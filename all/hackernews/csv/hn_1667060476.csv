I know I&#x27;m going to get stuff I don&#x27;t really need or want. I have my own money, if I need something I&#x27;ll buy it for myself. At best it will be chocolate or alcohol, even though I&#x27;d like to stop drinking.<p>I suck at buying gifts for other people. I can buy gift cards but that&#x27;s just transmuting money into something less valuable. I&#x27;ll usually try to think of something I have in common with the person I&#x27;m buying for and buy a book or something, but from what it sounds like they usually get sent to the shelf graveyard.<p>I just feel like Christmas is excessively consumerist and wasteful. Not to mention all of this is creating excess pollution. Lots of us order things online, receive it in a cardboard box and plastic, unwrap it, only to wrap it back up in paper and plastic again. It&#x27;s really silly.<p>I wish it was socially acceptable to say &quot;don&#x27;t buy me anything because I&#x27;m not buying you anything.&quot; My immediate family probably wouldn&#x27;t take heed and my extended family definitely wouldn&#x27;t.
