33386516,Ask HN: Is it a good time to take a break?,2022-10-29T18:08:35Z,throwaway_int3,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Dev, 25 years exp. Had a good “right place &#x2F; right time” run through some FAANGs so I could probably retire (chunky to fat) in ~3-5 more years of merely “staying the course”.
HOWEVER.<p>I’m massively burnt out. Like, severe depression burnt out. Go on medication for the first time in my life burnt out. Still love coding, but global events as well as very stressful last couple years of toil at work has left me in the worst state I’ve ever been in.<p>Additionally, I’ve spent the last 25 years wanting to “do my own thing,” but never giving into the urge - just optimizing for staying on track. I don’t mean bootstrap a startup, I mean indulge in work-adjacent curiosities. Make stuff for the sake of making it. That’s all.<p>It’s occurred to me that it might be a good time to kill several birds with one stone: take a year off.<p>I know not working for someone else for a year will supercharge recovering from depression. I had a couple month LOA this year and life got way better, but went right back to shit after LOA. It wasn’t long enough. Right now I’m trying to recover from work induced depression while working. It feels Sisyphean to say the least.<p>A year of getting to dabble in personal programming projects is a dream I’ve withheld from myself for multiple decades. Giving myself that gift … is a level of generosity that almost feels unimaginable.<p>Clearing my head for a year might let me find a new more sustainable way to work. I’ve stuck with FAANG because of great comp but I don’t like working on big teams&#x2F;big companies. I’ve never given myself the space to think about how else I can make money by coding (something I truly love) that suits my values and stage of life better than just continuing to grind in bloated FAANG companies.<p>Compensation is trending to the lowest it’s been in years due to depressed RSUs and potential of growth for those RSUs. In other words, this is kinda the lowest opportunity cost time to quit, I think. I’d be missing out on a period of very low compensation.<p>And I’ve been at my last gig for a LONG time. We all know that the longer you stay at a tech job, the more undercompensated you became, at least in terms of base. So leaving and then coming back to a new company, if couldn’t find a new non-FAANG path, is at least likely to boost earnings (reset RSU value too) and hasten retirement.<p>So why not do it?<p>* Unsure how far back it sets retirement. My FA can’t&#x2F;won’t tell me. He just says I can afford to take a year off.<p>* Re-employability. I’m obviously “old”. My resume is great, but I feel like age + gap year is not to be trifled with, esp if hiring is still icy a year from now.<p>* Might not want to go back ever?<p>* Medical catastrophe? I guess I just need to make sure I buy really good insurance during this time?<p>Should also mention I have a wife and kids and am also partially supporting my parents. I’m the sole earner. So the responsibility is large. Still, I can afford the year, but it’s scary.<p>Would really appreciate the wisdom of anyone who’s been at least close to this situation before.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
