I&#x27;ve been using atomics but as the complexity grows it becomes hard to review code for &quot;correctness&quot;. My goal is to avoid holding locks for long periods of time. Since this is a realtime application I also want to avoid waiting. So lock-free, wait-free is preferred.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
