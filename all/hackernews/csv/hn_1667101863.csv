Our product development is almost done, but we need a lot of money to launch our product to market (we are in fintech business). We don&#x27;t have that amount of money, and it is not even close.<p>So the real question is what to do after the company die? If I keep working on this, the company can stay in zombie mode for years. I honestly think we should shut the company down. My cofounder is telling me if I don&#x27;t keep working on this startup (using the money out of my cofounder &amp; me&#x27;s pocket after the company die), then I am being guilty to him, guilty to current investors and guilty to employees, because I am not all in.<p>What are your guys thought?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
