33391202,Tell HN: The Law of Success,2022-10-30T04:50:19Z,lifeplusplus,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Small rant, I&#x27;ve been mulling over few things.<p>The fundamental process that leads to success is...<p>- have energy<p>- be always using that energy<p>- be focused<p>The more you think about it, the truer it appears. It&#x27;s so simple yet so profound. I believe this insight has potential for to use as a grading metric to realign ourselves.<p>This &quot;law&quot; goes for smallest biological organism to biggest corporation out there.<p>For example:<p>- An organism that has no energy wont be able to pursue food.<p>- An organism that has energy but doesn&#x27;t do anything with it, is not different than an organism who has no energy.<p>- An organism who is always pursuing things at random won&#x27;t succeed catching anything, maybe beside few lucky breaks. Without focus it has no future.<p>Let&#x27;s translate this to a person...<p>- person who has no energy or time do anything, well wont do anything<p>- person who is stuck in action paralysis or waiting for a perfect moment, isn&#x27;t doing anything besides all of their potential. All of their intellect potential might as well have not existed, chances of them trying bunch of things and failing at all but one is higher than of them succeeding while doing nothing<p>- person who isn&#x27;t focusing on everything is focusing on nothing, this person will lose to person who is focusing 100% on their thing.<p>Insights:<p>- Get lucky or work toward having time&#x2F;energy&#x2F;attention available, or you are trapped. This is derivative effect of having good health, stable family, and financial wellbeing.<p>- Always be doing something even if it doesn&#x27;t look it will go anywhere, of course it&#x27;s better to be doing something that has more potential, but doing anything beats doing nothing 9&#x2F;10 times. The chances of making a connection, finding an insight, or becoming skilled at something that would cumulate into a big win in future go infinitely higher when doing something.<p>- Focus ruthlessly, being average or below average won&#x27;t help you have break throughs. Less than average effort into something will at best result in average outcomes.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
