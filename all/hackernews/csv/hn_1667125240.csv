33392911,Ask HN: How would you go about selling a website in 2022?(Legal Education Space),2022-10-30T09:56:49Z,jackkinsella,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"TLDR: How about you approach selling a website in 2022? Not just where to list it, but also what strategies would you use to find buyers who would get the most value from a property?
In detail:<p>I&#x27;ve want to sell a site called Oxbridge Notes https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk&#x2F; that sells study materials for law students. It&#x27;s been around about 13 years and gets about 350,000 organic&#x2F;direct users per year.<p>The current monetisation model is selling what are essentially e-books about law exams. Due to having a copious amount of public-facing content, there are also quite a few non-students looking up the law via the website, but I never found a way to monetise this segment.<p>So, from my perhaps simplistic point of view, I think the ideal buyer is either: - a larger player in the third-level study materials&#x2F;college notes space - an entity in the legal space (e.g. a law firm) that would be able to use the traffic to draw attention to itself or get link juice (search advertising is super expensive in this space)<p>Aside from listing on websites like Flippa, are there things I can realistically do to proactively search for a fitting buyer? (E.g. I don&#x27;t think cold-emailing the &quot;info@POTENTIAL-BUYER.com&quot; address would be effective -- but happy to be convinced otherwise.)<p>Thanks in advance.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
