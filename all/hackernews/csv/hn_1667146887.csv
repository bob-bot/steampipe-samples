From Tradfri bulbs to WLED RGBW LED strips, to 433MHz controlled plugs and Snapcast multi-room speakers. I even had switches that started random playlists on Spotify, or showed the weather and next bus stop on my Fire TV.<p>The only thing that I still use from that pile of waste is the motion controlled warm-white LED strip I soldered myself and flashed using ESPHome, because:<p>• it turns on when I enter the bathroom and it&#x27;s brighter than most bulbs<p>• after bedtime it only turns on at 20% brightness<p>• it&#x27;s local only, standalone, no Linux or hub needed<p>• I rarely have to manually adjust it<p>• it just works, I don&#x27;t have to debug&#x2F;restart&#x2F;troubleshoot anything<p>Almost every friend that stayed the night and used our bathroom, asked me where they can buy such a thing, and I ended up creating 1-2 strips for each because there&#x27;s nowhere to buy this set of features at a moderate price.<p>But I&#x27;m getting tired of soldering these strips for everyone, I&#x27;d love to buy a ready-made product that&#x27;s at least similar.<p>Which is why I&#x27;m asking, what smart-home hardware have you bought (or hacked) that really made your life easier?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

33395476,Swindler is a mind game for two or more players,2022-10-30T15:49:46Z,hot_gril,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"In the huge lines of Disneyland, my friend and I eventually ran out of things to talk about, so I created a game that doesn&#x27;t require any cards, dice, chips, etc. I later refined it thanks to some help on StackExchange (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gamedev.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;202999&#x2F;1v1-bartering-brain-game-see-any-problems&#x2F;203018?noredirect=1#comment369702_203018).<p>Here&#x27;s how it goes:<p>1. Find two or more players. For each round, designate one player as the buyer and one as the seller. All other players (if any) spectate.<p>2. Each player, think of two numbers from 0 to 49 inclusive. Say one aloud. Add the number the other person said to your secret one, and mod by 50. If you&#x27;re the buyer, add 50. Keep this one number in mind. Basically this step generates a random number for each player; you&#x27;re incentivized to make these as random as possible.<p>3. You are negotiating over the price of an item. If you&#x27;re the buyer, your number is the maximum B you will pay for the item. If you&#x27;re the seller, it&#x27;s the minimum S you will sell it for. Haggle until either a deal is reached at price P or someone walks away. You can enforce a reasonable time or bid limit.<p>4. Reveal S and B to all players. If a deal was reached, the buyer scores B - P points, and the seller scores P - S points, aka the &quot;profit.&quot; If no deal was reached, the buyer loses B - 50 points, and the seller loses 50 - S points, aka the &quot;desperation.&quot;<p>5. Change sides, or rotate peers if there are more than two players. Keep track of points.<p>There are some parallels to poker. There&#x27;s bluffing. Getting a low B or a high S is like drawing a strong hand, where you have more hidden power to exert. The no-deal penalty forces players to put skin in the game, except it&#x27;s much heavier than the typical poker blinds&#x2F;antes. In two-player mode, it&#x27;s effectively a zero-sum game.<p>But unlike poker, &gt;2 player games are not zero-sum. If there are enough rounds, players may feel incentivized to cooperate with each other so they reach fair deals instead of hurting each other with no-deal penalties.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
