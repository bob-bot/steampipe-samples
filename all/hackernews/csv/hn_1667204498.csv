Cards are created from list items, using delimeters like `?::` to separate the question&#x2F;answer (or front&#x2F;back) from one another.<p>Example:<p>---<p># The Solar System<p>- Number of planets ?:: 8<p>## Planets<p>- Mars<p><pre><code>  - Color ?:: red
</code></pre>
---<p>This will create two cards:<p>(1)<p>Path: The Solar System<p>Front: Number of planets<p>Back: 8<p>(2)<p>Path: The Solar System &gt; Planets &gt; Mars<p>Front: Color<p>Back: Red<p>Other tools to generate Anki cards from Markdown exist, but none worked well with nested lists. I also really wanted to have a &quot;path&quot;, generated from headings&#x2F;ancestral list items, to enable very succint cards, such as the `Color ?:: red`.<p>I hope it might be of use to someone else.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kerrickstaley&#x2F;genanki"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kerrickstaley&#x2F;genanki</a>",story,https://github.com/vangberg/ankivalenz,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
