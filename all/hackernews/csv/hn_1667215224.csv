33404263,Ask HN: Stacking forces in a physics engine C++,2022-10-31T11:16:31Z,leakbang,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"So for a game that I&#x27;m working on I have looked at a lot of the widely used and widely praised physics engines (Havoc, Bullet, PhysX, Jolt, Newton Dynamics, ...) to implement in my game but after reviewing each one of them I came to the conclusion that it is best if I create my own physics resolver.<p>The aforementioned physics engines failed basic physics tests or had very complex code bases to the point that I think this route will be easier.
I did notice that many of these engines especially PhysX and Bullet do a lot of tricks to correct their simulations. I assume one reason that they include such tricks is to optimize for performance on a wide range of hardware.<p>So I think it couldn&#x27;t be that hard to write a simple (rigidbody) physics resolver that is only designed to run in a single thread on X86 based processors. And also I don&#x27;t think I need to mess around with too many optimizations since the levels in my game are pretty small, so I might just be able to get away with it.
I never dabbled too much into the nuts and bolts of a physics engine so I am quite unsure about certain things could be done.<p>For instance let&#x27;s assume a simple case. I have a digital scale and I want to measure the weight of whatever&#x27;s on top of it. So the way I would like to do it is to simply measure the amount of force that is being applied to the surface of the scale and display that. That way, when 2 objects are stacked on top of each other, it shows the correct stacked weight. Or if there is another object like a press, pushing towards the surface of the scale, then it also would show the force that the press is applying.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to implement a system like this. Do you know of a cool way of achieving a system like this?
Also if you have any tips or cool resources for physics simulations, I&#x27;d appreciate them!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
