It started with one or two large beers in the evening and  around 2016 progressed to a 6 pack (12 oz&#x2F;375ml) every evening, sometimes more. Since the pandemic started, I lost all control (it wasn&#x27;t helped by the fact that just before the pandemic struck I moved to a country where I don&#x27;t speak the language and have no friends)<p>I recently started thinking of the damage to my brain. I work as a software engineer and I had some performance problems. My junior colleagues outperform me, and I think I might not be as sharp as I used to. I&#x27;m almost 40yo and I wonder if I permanently lost my skills due to alcoholism.<p>I managed to cut down my drinking in the past 3 months. According to my doctor my physical health is fine (including the liver), but I somehow feel sick and constantly tired.<p>Has any of you had a similar experience or witness this happening to your colleagues or friends? I&#x27;m worried mostly about the brain and thinking if I should just look for an easier job.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
