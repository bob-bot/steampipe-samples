To see, mainly how we can adapt to this new world of Elon leading Twitter with its high potential and many risks as well.<p>A number of things change, now that Elon is running Twitter. First off, that&#x27;s horrible news for many. I hope Twitter HR (who should be under a lot of pressure right now) are doing a good job, handling the logistics there.<p>In terms of Twitter product management teams though, I think they can get inspired by serious conversations in the community as to what features they will now put forward and to what degree, will they allow for communities to speak freely, which would be a way to actually also test a different layer of claims for Elon, in the lines, the bird is free. I mean, at some point, how free are we talking? Free as in Freedom or Free as in for as long as it serves my purposes.<p>There are so many other topics I could lay out here. For instance, some food for thought, maybe was Elon&#x27;s claims as to the discrepancy in the number of human users vs. robots. Well, I&#x27;d like to understand the process that will go into creating transparency around exactly how we&#x27;re going to go about handing robots.<p>So, while he may or may not have been right about those claims, now we need to hold him accountable for how open his approach is going to be, in addressing those very same concerns.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discuss.logseq.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;hello-from-sina-from-brussels-a-vibrant-new-member-of-your-community&#x2F;11988&#x2F;5<p>Small side note: Mr. Musk also needs to understand to keep his power controlled for he might fall into traps only a few people have survived in history. Nelson Mandela, Cyrus the great, Darius, was it? Absolute power corrupts absolutely has been the rule, except for three so far. You might argue how we can know that to be three. Well, the answer is that when an individual has absolute power, it cannot go unseen. In most cases, it leads to wars and chaos, but it leads to good things when it is controlled like those three individuals built great civilisations, it so happens.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
