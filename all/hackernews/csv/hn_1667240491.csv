You would build your business logic into services, that could call other services, within the context of the transaction, and you rely on TP monitors for transaction handling logic.<p>In modern times, we build systems based on microservices. When we do changes that touch data in multiple microservices, we could use transaction managers and 2-phase commit, but this does not seem very common. More typical pattern seems to be to go with eventual consistency.<p>However, there are fields where eventual consistency is not sufficient, such as banking, insurance, and finance. What kind of architectures and systems are used in those fields when systems are modernized?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
