I&#x27;m building software to incentivize positive habit formation, routine maintenance, and daily mindfulness.<p>I settled on the idea after reflecting on how my life has changed since I started a fully remote, work-from-home routine without a live-in partner. I&#x27;ve always been self-motivated and independent. WFH helped me lean heavily into that aspect of myself - perhaps a little too heavily. Overall, while I feel WFH to be a strong net positive that I am unwilling to abandon, I find myself wanting to consciously push back against the days blurring together due to poor work&#x2F;life boundaries and I find myself wanting more tangible outlets for getting my thoughts &quot;out there&quot; due to lack of unplanned chitchat.<p>Does the notion of &quot;I starkly prefer work-from-home over work-from-office, but miss the &#x27;forced&#x27; social structure&#x2F;support provided by traditional work-from-office environments&quot; ring true to you? Are your days broadly better as long as you keep on your daily routine, but, if your routine slips, you find there&#x27;s less humane society to integrate with in an effort to rebound? And, if you&#x27;ll forgive me for being a bit ironic, have you explored any software solutions for mitigating these concerns?<p>Irrespective of your experience - positive or negative - please share. I don&#x27;t want to mislead myself into believing an anecdotal, personal issue is representative of a societal trend. Thanks!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
