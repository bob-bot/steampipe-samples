If the latter, how would you decentralize it without sacrificing the &quot;public town square&quot; effect that Twitter currently has but is clearly lacking with the fragmentation of Mastodon?<p>To answer my own question, I would probably build a centralized platform like Twitter is now, probably opt for a fast NoSQL database like Google&#x27;s Firestore in Datastore mode and to keep things simple I would probably even make sure that tweets would get automatically deleted after some years as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s needed to build a forever growing database of people&#x27;s thoughts in that moment that persists for decades to come. Micro-blogging always felt to me as a thing right now, a thought in this moment but that thought could be different in a few days, months and definitely a few years, so why store it forever.

This software is SMALL and fast.  This is obvious, but it raises the question, how much of our day to day software is just bloated to have features for a marketing list?  90% of what I&#x27;d need is here and do I really need Word or its clones?
