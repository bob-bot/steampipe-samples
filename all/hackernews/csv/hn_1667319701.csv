Considering the US has experimented with red light cameras with well below good results overall, from a safety claim. Speed is a significant safety issue (or at least the authorities and the insurance people keep saying and making the rules to enforce) but we also have guns. Lots of guns.<p>Take almost an exact duplicate of the standard &#x2F; common residential speed camera, drop a few of them in rural-ish or adjacent areas in TN, KY, AR and maybe GA, and make one distinct change: put a large sign on it that says “CAMERA ONLY CAPTURES FOOTAGE OF SPEEDERS”<p>I’d guess it’s less than a week before somebody figures out driving slow also helps with aim.

Today we added supported for AWS (this video was made right before).<p>We started on this project when we noticed the various quirks with the default search engine in the GCP console. For example, substring search not applied on various kinds of resources. Additionally, we wanted to query across workspaces simultaneously, rather than having to iterate through and query each one individually.<p>We have a live demo available but we don&#x27;t think it makes sense asking strangers and the HN crowd to authorize us to this data.<p>This search product is one component of our platform. We want to make reading data from the cloud resources you own easier but also also making provisioning easier too.<p>Utilizing cloud infrastructure effectively is difficult for companies small and large. Employers cite the skills gap as the biggest challenge in their cloud adoption. DevOps is also a cost center for most organizations outside the pure tech plays. Cloud Engineers are expensive. Large enterprises can absorb this overhead but it&#x27;s tough on SMEs. Platform-as-a-service alleviates companies of this burden but introduces a cost structure that will end up costing more at scale. Furthermore, it becomes increasingly expensive to migrate as you integrate deeper into PaaS.<p>We think we can solve this cost dilemma by providing thin abstractions over infrastructure-as-a-service wherein clients retain the optionality to readily go back to their underlying infrastructure. Unlike PaaS which much recoup R&amp;D investments on proprietary service implementations, we want to open this up to 3rd parties so that we can focus on the contract layer (service brokering).<p>The Search product is more meaningful for enterprises operating at scale with unwieldy complexity. The Low-Code-No-Code provisioning product is suitable for SMEs that are just getting started on their cloud journey and don&#x27;t have the bandwidth for CloudOps but also where the cost structure of PaaS doesn&#x27;t make sense. This product is still under development and we would love to have users try our prototype.<p>Regards",story,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuPIEYtFZuo,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
