It was originally based on a purely &quot;classical&quot; algorithm, but since then Deep Learning has taken over the field, leaving us with the simple choice to adapt or die.<p>Most of our old competitors shut down. The new competition is &quot;a bunch of kids&quot;. We&#x27;re two 40+ year olds with young kids, mortgages, and a 15 year investment in classical image processing algorithms rendered largely obsolete by Deep Learning. Fun times.<p>So it&#x27;s been challenging, interesting, humbling &amp; frustrating to switch out our entire toolbox and go from zero to our first full end-to-end DL solution for background removal over these last few years. It&#x27;s been a journey with fits and starts. Classical algorithms are slow-and-steady work, craftsmanship if you will. DL is much more &quot;doesn&#x27;t work, doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s a miracle, no it&#x27;s crap, fixed it with better data, now don&#x27;t touch the golden recipe!&quot;<p>(Along the way CM got a little DL boost, but it&#x27;s a DL + classical algorithms hybrid)<p>The big takeaway for us has been that DL is <i>all about the data</i>. The networks get all the glory, but it&#x27;s the data that makes the bulk of the difference.<p>While we have a host of ideas for changing the business model for background removal to enable a wider range of use-cases, right now we&#x27;re primarily looking for feedback on this very early MVP.<p>Thanks!<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5682831"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=5682831</a>",story,https://pixian.ai/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

33439118,Show HN: nudges.fyi – call/SMS/email reminders for people who dislike todo apps,2022-11-02T17:00:12Z,tta,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I built this app primarily for my wife, who has tried many mainstream todo-list apps (OmniFocus, Things, and Todoist come to mind) over the years with little success. She isn&#x27;t particularly interested in setting up a productivity system and the administrivia that goes with it. Even having to remember to look at an app once a day was far from ideal for her. This app is an attempt at a solution for anyone that fits this description, with a focus on alerting over organization.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works: you create a nudge that&#x27;s set to trigger at a given date and time, and the app phones you, texts you, or emails you (or all three) at the right moment. Nudges can trigger on a schedule, so something like &quot;call me about monthly bills for the next month on the last day of every month&quot; is quite easy to set up. It also works well (sample size 1, admittedly) as a supplement to a more robust GTD system. I use Things for almost everything, but my most important reminders are set up as nudges.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on this on and off for the last month or so and I think it&#x27;s ready for a Show HN. There&#x27;s likely some rough edges in there so I wouldn&#x27;t use it for anything _critical_ just yet (let me know if you see anything that looks buggy!). I cut a lot of scope in order to release an initial version quickly; here&#x27;s a list of things I&#x27;m considering adding to the app in the near future:<p><pre><code>  - Implement something analogous to Pagerduty: create nudges that repeatedly nag you (with something like an escalation policy) until you acknowledge them
  - More notification channels: get nudges on Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, etc.
  - Families (or teams, possibly) share a namespace and can send nudges to each other
  - Nudges that collect a response: possibly for polls, a daily diary entry, or habit tracker
  - Incoming and outgoing webhooks
  - Snooze a nudge so it re-triggers in X minutes
</code></pre>
I work on distributed systems at my day job and haven&#x27;t done frontend and CRUD things in a long while now, so building this out was a nice change of pace. If anyone&#x27;s curious, the app is built with: Next.js (in static HTML mode) and Tailwind for the frontend, Go for the API server and background nudge loop, and SQLite (+Litestream) for persistence.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m looking for feedback from the HN community here: is this something you would use?<p>TL;DR: schedule reminders for yourself via phone call, text message, and&#x2F;or email<p>(PS: the free plan doesn&#x27;t allow call&#x2F;SMS nudges because I&#x27;m a bit wary of spam, but if you&#x27;d like to give this a shot and can&#x27;t [or don&#x27;t want to] subscribe to a paid plan at this point, send me an email at tim@nudges.fyi for a 1-month code)",story,https://nudges.fyi,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
