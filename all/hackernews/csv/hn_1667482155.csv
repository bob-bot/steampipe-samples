I have come upon good financial fortune recently and took a step back from day-to-day work as a software engineer. After a few months of downtime, I&#x27;m now ready to jump back into work, but given I no longer have any financial stress I&#x27;d like to focus on ways to use my skills to give back to the community. I&#x27;ve been writing startup software for 10+ years, have co-founded a company and exited.<p>What does HN think are some good ways to give back? Here are some avenues I&#x27;ve explored but have come up dry:<p>* Teaching: I&#x27;d love to teach programming to high schoolers, but most positions require some post-grad&#x2F;PhD, which I do not have.<p>* Non-profit &#x2F; civic work: I&#x27;d love to work with USDS, 18F, or something like that, but there don&#x27;t seem to be as many open positions and USDS requires folks to be on-site in DC (not possible for me).<p>* Mentorship programs: I&#x27;ve done a few mentorship programs in the past, but is very high touch and infrequent - I&#x27;d like to do something more hands-on.<p>Thanks HN!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
