After a few months of downtime, I&#x27;m now ready to jump back into work, but given I no longer have any financial stress I&#x27;d like to focus on ways to use my skills to give back to the community. I&#x27;ve been writing startup software for 10+ years, have co-founded a company and exited.<p>What does HN think are some good ways to give back? Here are some avenues I&#x27;ve explored but have come up dry:<p>* Teaching: I&#x27;d love to teach programming to high schoolers, but most positions require some post-grad&#x2F;PhD, which I do not have.<p>* Non-profit &#x2F; civic work: I&#x27;d love to work with USDS, 18F, or something like that, but there don&#x27;t seem to be as many open positions and USDS requires folks to be on-site in DC (not possible for me).<p>* Mentorship programs: I&#x27;ve done a few mentorship programs in the past, but is very high touch and infrequent - I&#x27;d like to do something more hands-on.<p>Thanks HN!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We offer open-source user authentication and we just released our user roles product for companies implementing authorization.<p>Our users are web developers, and a prominent and adjacent pain point for our users is authorization. Developers typically implement two independent solutions for authentication and authorization. Offering AuthN and AuthZ in a single solution is something we’ve been thinking about for the last few years.<p>Quick primer, authentication is knowing who the user is, and authorization is knowing what the user has access to. A physical analogy: A person enters a building. Authentication means reading their ID card and knowing that the person’s name is John. Authorization means knowing which floors, offices, and files John has access to.<p>With increasing privacy and data complexity, companies like Netflix[1], Slack[2], and Airbnb[3] have built out their own complex authorization systems.<p>To build our user roles product, we started with a first principles approach of covering authorization use cases using scripting languages such as XACML and OPA. But looking at existing solutions built by talented teams like Oso[4], Aserto[5], Cerbos[6], Strya[7], we realized that while these were powerful solutions, they were often overkill for most early to mid-stage companies (especially on the B2C side).<p>We went back to the drawing board, reached out to our users and after dozens of conversations, we realized that most authorization needs require the ability to<p>1. Assign and manage roles and permissions<p>2. Store roles in the DB and session tokens to make it readable on the frontend and<p>3. Protect APIs and websites based on these roles and permissions.<p>And so, we built user roles – a simple RBAC authorization service that focuses on the balance between simplicity and utility. It doesn’t cover many complex cases and we’re not looking to displace any of the authorization incumbents. But you can add AuthN and AuthZ using a single solution, quickly.<p>In the near future, we’ll be launching an admin GUI where you can manage your users and their roles with a few clicks.<p>We’d love for you to try it out and hear what additional functionality you’d like to see.

We made LMRTFY (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lmrt.fyi"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lmrt.fyi</a>), a tool to share compute functions running anywhere with others without sharing your code.<p>In engineering sharing algorithms is often done via source code which is cumbersome if you need special resource (GPU, propietary data sets, …) and impossible if you need to protect your IP.<p>We created a a open-core platform to share functions bound to specific resources without sharing the actual implementation. Shared functions can be called from your code. Just like any regular function.<p>Find the open source tool on GitHub (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lmrtfy&#x2F;lmrtfy"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lmrtfy&#x2F;lmrtfy</a>) or dive right into the docs (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.lmrt.fyi&#x2F;latest&#x2F;quickstart"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.lmrt.fyi&#x2F;latest&#x2F;quickstart</a>).<p>Unfortunately, we need to require you to sign up because otherwise our servers would be vulnerable and we couldn’t make sure that only you can access your function (E-mail verification is not enforced right now). Alternatively, you can use social logins (google, GitHub).<p>If you like this project, please star us on GitHub!<p>We are very thankful for any feedback!
