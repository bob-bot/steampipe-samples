We publish books by grade level, build a full courseware on top, then turn them into feature films. Watch trailer here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Y2cTcqwuzKM<p>Metrics Since Our YC S21 Launch: Schools have reported up to 86% improvement in student ELA performance in just 4 months of adopting Litnerd.<p>Why Consider B2C: We have often been asked to open up our product and offer B2C (for ex, this request dominated our HackerNews launch) but we never felt ready to offer something of value to the home-school community. Up until recently, we have been offering a Supplemental (add-on) literacy program to schools. It just wasn’t something we felt parents could benefit from.<p>What Changed: As of this school year, we now offer schools a Core (full 40 week) literacy program. This means, we can finally start thinking of providing parents a full stand-alone package for their children to support their home-school efforts. We would also like to offer a supplemental add-on for parents who just want additional reading support for their child after-school.<p>Parent Survey Request: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mntozr88sxz.typeform.com&#x2F;Litnerd-b2c<p>Having said that, serving parents directly is dramatically different than serving schools directly. I know I will benefit tremendously from your feedback as a parent. It should only take about 5-7 minutes. Thank you so much for helping us better understand your needs. I appreciate your time.<p>- anisa mirza",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
