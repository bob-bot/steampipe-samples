ADD doesn&#x27;t help, of course, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure it is that relevant.<p>The problem is of course that I cycle through all of those topics and because the surface is really large, I&#x27;m not making too much of progress on any of them - at least when measured externally by comparing to other people who are focused on one thing.<p>Today I saw a petition about bringing back Henry Cavill to Witcher TV series and it dawned on me.<p>I surveyed my past, I surveyed people who I know that are really good at something. And there is a pattern.<p>All those people are more or less obsessed about their fields, whether software engineering, photography, jazz guitar or whatever. Some people are clearly obsessed even by things like TV shows.<p>In my life, however, I was never obsessed by anything. This realization is quite shocking to me.<p>I would like to at least try and see what is it like to be obsessed by something. Maybe that is a missing ingredient in my life.<p>So my question is: how to trigger a mild obsession about something - and if possible, how to do it in a controlled way so that I don&#x27;t get lost in the rabbit hole.<p>What are sources of your obsessions, people of HN? Is it possible to trace the reasons back to some root causes?<p>Thanks!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We publish books by grade level, build a full courseware on top, then turn them into feature films. Watch trailer here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Y2cTcqwuzKM<p>Metrics Since Our YC S21 Launch: Schools have reported up to 86% improvement in student ELA performance in just 4 months of adopting Litnerd.<p>Why Consider B2C: We have often been asked to open up our product and offer B2C (for ex, this request dominated our HackerNews launch) but we never felt ready to offer something of value to the home-school community. Up until recently, we have been offering a Supplemental (add-on) literacy program to schools. It just wasn’t something we felt parents could benefit from.<p>What Changed: As of this school year, we now offer schools a Core (full 40 week) literacy program. This means, we can finally start thinking of providing parents a full stand-alone package for their children to support their home-school efforts. We would also like to offer a supplemental add-on for parents who just want additional reading support for their child after-school.<p>Parent Survey Request: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mntozr88sxz.typeform.com&#x2F;Litnerd-b2c<p>Having said that, serving parents directly is dramatically different than serving schools directly. I know I will benefit tremendously from your feedback as a parent. It should only take about 5-7 minutes. Thank you so much for helping us better understand your needs. I appreciate your time.<p>- anisa mirza",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
