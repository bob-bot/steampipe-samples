33457852,Show HN: I've Made a DevOps Course,2022-11-03T21:23:51Z,predmijat,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello HN,<p>I&#x27;ve made a DevOps course covering a lot of different technologies and applications,
aimed at startups, small companies and individuals.<p>To get this out of the way - this course doesn&#x27;t cover Kubernetes or similar -
I&#x27;m of the opinion that for startups and small companies you probably don&#x27;t need Kubernetes.
For small teams it usually brings more problems than benefits,
and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.<p>As for prerequisites, you can&#x27;t be a complete beginner in the world of computers.
If you&#x27;ve never even heard of Docker, if you don&#x27;t have even the slightest idea what DNS is,
or if you don&#x27;t have any experience with Linux, this course is probably not for you.
That being said, I do explain the basics too, but probably not in enough detail
for a complete beginner.<p>The course is available at Udemy, and here&#x27;s a 100% OFF coupon URL (1000 of those available):<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udemy.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish&#x2F;?couponCode=FREEDEVOPS2211CJDUA"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udemy.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;real-world-devops-project-from-...</a><p>Be sure to BUY the course for $0, and not sign up for Udemy&#x27;s subscription plan.
The Subscription plan is selected by default, but you want the BUY checkbox.
If you see a price other than $0, chances are that all coupons have been used already.<p>I encourage you to watch &quot;free preview&quot; videos, but here&#x27;s the gist:<p>The goal of the course is to create an easily deployable and reproducible server
which will have &quot;everything&quot; a start up or a small company will need - VPN, mail, Git,
CI&#x2F;CD, messaging, hosting websites and services, sharing files, calendar, etc.
It can also be useful to individuals who want to self-host all of those - I ditched Google 99.9%
and other than that being a good feeling, I&#x27;m not worried that some AI bug will lock my account
with no one to talk to about resolving the issue.<p>Considering that it covers a wide variety of topics, it doesn&#x27;t go in depth in any of those.
Think of it as going down a highway towards the end destination, but on the way there I show you
all the junctions where I think it&#x27;s useful to do more research on the subject.<p>We&#x27;ll deploy services inside Docker and LXC (Linux Containers). Those will include
a mail server (iRedMail), Zulip (Slack and Microsoft Teams alternative), GitLab (with GitLab runner and CI&#x2F;CD),
Nextcloud (file sharing, calendar, contacts, etc.), checkmk (monitoring solution), Pi-hole (ad blocking on DNS level),
Traefik with Docker and file providers (a single HTTP&#x2F;S entry point with automatic routing and TLS certificates).<p>We&#x27;ll set up WireGuard, a modern and fast VPN solution for secure access to VPS&#x27; internal network,
and I&#x27;ll also show you how to get a wildcard TLS certificate with certbot and DNS provider.<p>To wrap it all up, we&#x27;ll write a simple Python application that will compare a list of the desired backups
with the list of finished backups, and send a result to a Zulip stream.
We&#x27;ll write the application, do a &#x27;git push&#x27; to GitLab which will trigger a CI&#x2F;CD pipeline
that will build a Docker image, push it to a private registry, and then,
with the help of the GitLab runner, run it on the VPS and post a result to a Zulip stream with a webhook.<p>If you apply the coupon, I&#x27;d appreciate if you leave your feedback on Udemy
after you&#x27;re done and spread the word about the course. It would mean a lot.<p>If you&#x27;d like to support me, you can instead use this 80% OFF coupon:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udemy.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;real-world-devops-project-from-start-to-finish&#x2F;?couponCode=80OFFDEVOPS2211FJKDA"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.udemy.com&#x2F;course&#x2F;real-world-devops-project-from-...</a><p>I hope that you find it useful.<p>Happy learning,
