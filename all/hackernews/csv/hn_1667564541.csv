I had a full time job, did my crypto-sideproject, I was laser focused. 
It took off and was extremely successful. Quit my job.<p>NOW a year later. I&#x27;m just overwhelmed. Overwhelmed with the bureaucracy and a lot of pending issues:<p>- Tax declaration. Is pending. Accountant extremely slow. Have to think about it every day. Sometimes need to give feedback on some points. Extremly expensive.<p>- Bank&#x27;s want my Tax declaration and the source of wealth. Don&#x27;t accept the money. Have nearly every week a meeting or a request for some documents. They are very slow.<p>- Money is in crypto and at risk, till the bank&#x27;s will accept it.<p>Currently, I really can&#x27;t get things done. Waking up and thinking how that shit will end. Didn&#x27;t do anything for my project for months. The regulatory things, just progress so slow and are distracting me.<p>Any Idea how to deal with it?
