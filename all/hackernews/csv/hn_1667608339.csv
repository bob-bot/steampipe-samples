33476151,Ask HN: Why did GPG / PGP fail?,2022-11-05T00:24:07Z,charles_f,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"PGP and GPG have been around for a long time, but they don&#x27;t seem that have reached wide adoption - notably none of the massive Gmail, Hotmails and Yahoos of the world* have adopted it. The technology is strong, decentralized, and easy to setup if you&#x27;re moderately technologically literate, and surely could be completely abstracted away by any platform willing to do so. There are even browser extensions like mailvelope that allow you to add the GPG overlay to any webmail.<p>Meanwhile we&#x27;re still relying massively on email, sending un-encrypted bits of texts, with no way of authenticating the sender with 100% reliability. We receive tons of spam. All the protections that are put in place - DKIM, SPF, are hard to setup and imperfect. These seem problems that GPG could help tremendously with.<p>In parallel, technologies like Oauth, and now WebAuthn that bear somewhat similar concepts, are receiving massive adoption.<p>So it gets me to wonder: what&#x27;s the catch? Why isn&#x27;t <i>everyone</i> using GPG now? Even without knowing it?<p>* sure, Proton and Fast might be different but they&#x27;re 2 OM smaller",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I spent 5 of those in the same company - company A, working up from a Grad engineer to an SDE3, 3 promos, in that company. I had a very few stumbles there and always performed and handled transition pretty well.<p>I jumped ship January of this year over company changes, projects getting cancelled and stopping from a revolving door of Product heads coming in and out. My goal is not to get a senior title but to progress in my knowledge and move on from JS over to a Java focus. I want to build a product or even just some features; I want to code and earn my way to seniority; not start and stop every quarter.<p>I move to the next company, Company B, in March as SDE; everyone else on the team is Senior SDE with 7+ years experience and above: I&#x27;m the most junior.<p>Company B is a start up and I&#x27;m expected to contribute from the off; build out big features and bring some solid knowledge base to the team... but I just totally crap the bed.<p>The code I write is problematic; there&#x27;s no documentation to set stuff up, so I go without the code running on my local machine for a while, which obviously causes issues. I make a bunch of amateur mistakes and my direct team lead takes a dislike to me for, naturally, messing up a lot. I go from the guy who can solve the problem and save the day to the guy causing the problem; I&#x27;m not trusted at all (and why would they)?<p>I&#x27;m lashed with negative feedback in my first couple weeks, so buck up and genuinely put huge effort in; my code gets better, but the team lead expects tickets closed faster than I can. I feel incredibly untalented and dreadful at my job; every one of my system design choices are the incorrect ones and aren&#x27;t taken into account. Eventually - right before probation ends - I&#x27;m terminated when I fail to complete an MVP of a new system feature.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;d seen the writing on the wall, started interviewing elsewhere and now work at Company C, but as a Senior Software Engineer this time.<p>Company C is a big company in a bit of a niche area. I&#x27;m working on a team migrating from a dreadful old system to a more modern Micro-service base system. I&#x27;m expecting to do dreadful and underperform, get fired and end up exiting the industry within a couple weeks.<p>Instead, I&#x27;m back to my old self again: I&#x27;m reviewing code with confidence, pushing up solid features, contributing to initiatives and mentoring junior developers again. The code and features I write are solid and passing QA.<p>There&#x27;s no tech lead helping me, so I&#x27;m just using my gut and it&#x27;s going swimmingly. I have discussions with the other senior engineer on the team and my technical knowledge is respected; my relationship with my manager is pleasant and I&#x27;m performing accordingly.<p>It&#x27;s only been a couple months but I feel like myself again; like I went from the back of the herd to the front of the pack... but I&#x27;m still so confused about what exactly is the root of my performance increase; or rather, what made me become worse.<p>Has anyone else ever had this sort of experience, this sort of bumpy ride in their career? Are start-ups hard to work in that larger companies specifically because of expectations, of what&#x27;s considered &quot;appropriate&quot; at different levels? Am I just a lucky idiot fumbling back in and not even realising?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
