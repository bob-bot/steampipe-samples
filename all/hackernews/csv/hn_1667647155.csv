I was curious enough to sift through different publications and videos regarding human conflicts, discoveries and pandemics.<p>One thing I realized is that most of human history is actually written in favor of the victors or ruling classes absolving them from their own fraud or wrong doings.<p>Many unjustly wars veiled as justly ones. Inventions copied or stolen by self-proclaimed scientists. Profit over human lives.<p>This information would be vital for future human beings in writing their wrongs, but we keep on repeating the same mistakes over and over again for centuries.<p>Does that mean human nature is self-destructive? if we recorded history as it was for all human beings then we would we become a better civilization? Or would it cause more havoc in our societies?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
