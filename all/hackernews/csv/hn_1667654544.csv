The salary increase is not bad and the title is a move up (I think). I&#x27;m getting to an architect role up from Senior Dev. WLB will be a bit worse though. I&#x27;m currently in a known product company in Telecoms sector.I&#x27;m in my 40s and have worked mostly as a SW dev up to now. The new role won&#x27;t be hands-on as the roles I had so far (so I&#x27;d be very interested to read experiences from people that did a similar move).<p>Is that a good move professionally? Does it  make sense? What are the downsides of moving from a regular product company to a consultancy? Would such a move increase my future prospects or narrow them? I need to be in business in some way or another for at least another 20 years.<p>No significant connections or network. I mean I won&#x27;t be able to move to a high power&#x2F;salary position to which this role would be a good stepping stone. Just me with my abilities have to be marketable for a good few years to come.<p>Thanks,story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
