I am a software engineer with just 1 year of experience :).<p>I currently working towards breaking our products (In Angular and .net) into manageable chunks of components and libraries. We currently have 4-5 applications, which uses most of the similar components.
I&#x27;m starting from frontend. I know how to break them; but I am stuck at how to actually ship them so my team could collaborate on them? How to structure the housekeeping for all these libraries we are making? From where and How to consume them effectively to develop projects? How does other companies making all these angular and node packages manage this? Do i just push each of these into separate Repo? Cause that seems like a bad idea..
You guys have any references or links. Sorry for all these questions?
