of recent vintage. Ngrams viewer says the phrase started in the mid-20th century and took off only in the &#x27;00s.<p>Books, newspapers, journals, and special interest groups have existed for centuries before that but there were no such concerns over &quot;echo chambers.&quot;<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t see anything bad about online echo chambers. I feel comfortable spending most of my online life in my echo chamber with people of the same mental and moral wavelength.<p>I generally don&#x27;t feel I have anything valuable to learn from other ideologies because their moral values make me very uncomfortable.<p>Once in a while, I go into other echo chambers out of curiosity to verify if my predictions about them over some issue are correct. So it&#x27;s not like our echo chambers are unreachable to one another.<p>I think of them as different conference rooms at a large seminar. We accept that some attendees will choose to not enter some rooms.
We accept that a random person jumping on the stage, grabbing the mike, and saying uncomfortable ideas is against social norms, even antisocial.<p>At a progressive meet, it may be someone shouting homosexuality is unnatural. At a conservative meet, it may be someone saying it&#x27;s natural.<p>Either way, the norms of behavior are the same. We accept that calling security or cops to haul them out isn&#x27;t an outrageous reaction. Reddit implements this conference room analogy well.<p>But I see a lot of people - here on HN and elsewhere - repeat the axiom &quot;echo chambers are bad&quot; or &quot;end up with an echo chamber&quot; as if it&#x27;s a bad or unnatural thing though that&#x27;s how we live IRL.<p>If you have this anti-echo-chamber sentiment, can you explain why echo chambers are bad, especially when they are accessible to all other echo chambers?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
