Impossible to update for forced update<p>Have been adversely affected by the failure of Whatsapp forced update, which caused a permanent lock out.<p>The problem is having a block screen that forces an update when it is known to be impossible for some phones to get that update. The phone platform SDK seems to have stopped supporting older OS versions that are working well on an older phone that is fully functional.<p>So far, the past few forced updates have been fine and the block screen gets resolved. But this time the update did not work.<p>There seems to be no available proper way to remove the block screen to access messages. So the block screen is literally just a permanent lock out, and does not work to convince a user to update Whatsapp.<p>Can a Whatsapp engineer please do this: Use the older version of the phone SDK to create a separate app update for older phones that will remove the block screen and allow the user on the older phone to access the main app, send messages and to be able to back up messages to a computer, by local wifi&#x2F;bluetooth or something, without a &quot;cloud&quot; that puts your messages on insecure places.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

In his personal blog[0], he has been writing about technology and society for years. He has also a YouTube channel[1][2] to teach and encourage Iranians to programming and Linux, and a podcast[3] that has been explaining technology and science news along with his comments for several years. All this in a country with a dictatorial government where standing in the right place has a heavy price.<p>His arrest occurred on October 5, a few days after the recent nationwide protests[4] began in Iran. Arrest at home with beating. The reason for this is not yet clear, but it is probably due to his efforts to increase awareness of the society about Iran&#x27;s internet censorship system, and his positions against a company called ArvanCloud. Many claim this company help the government of Iran in implementing the internet censorship&#x27;s system (something like Great Firewall of China). In Jadi&#x27;s own words, this company has made it possible for the government to turn the Internet into an intranet at any moment and block people&#x27;s access to international services. Something that happens in every demonstration in Iran including right now.<p>The reason I am writing here is to raise awareness about him, which may lead to his release. All this may be nothing more than a false hope, but it is what I can do. From the news he covered in his podcast, it could be guessed that he is one of the regular readers of Hacker News. Perhaps hearing your support here will boost his morale behind bars in Evin.
