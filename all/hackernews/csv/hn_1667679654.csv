The first 30 minutes will be silent as we add and categorize things around on the board, then we&#x27;ll review ideas together.&quot;<p>&quot;Actually, this method is rooted in BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOLOGY and we should talk about why that matters. I took three courses on behavioral psychology, and also my aunt is an established real estate marketer and life coach, so I&#x27;ve got a strong sense of how we should proceed with the user engagement initiative.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s like these product managers found Tony Robbins, Socrates, and a washed out VP Product on Substack, mashed everything together in Roam Research, and now all they do is talk, and talk, and talk about mental models, and frameworks, and motivation, and how to format a PRD, or product spec, or whether we should A&#x2F;B test single words, or how long a table of contents should be, or whether we should use a template in Confluence for new documentation, and on, and on.<p>It&#x27;s like Farnam Street fucked FigJam and out come a generation of framework-focused and risk averse product managers who have made a career out TALKING about building product but never shipping anything that matters. The only work they do is write documents  about best practices for writing other documents.<p>It&#x27;s knowledge porn for people with no skill, no taste, and no track record of making good decisions.
