33486608,Pageblox - Turn your designs into 1-page sites,2022-11-05T22:31:56Z,bhavansri,2,false,false,2,[33486699],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN!<p>I started working on Pageblox after noticing a bunch of my friends sent invites to large events, like weddings and such, that were created using Canva or some design tool. Because of this, they were static images or PDFs and lacked the ability to be interactive like websites.<p>This limited the user experience for the creators and receivers. Guests clicking on location won&#x27;t deep-link them to Google Maps, and clicking on the date&#x2F;time doesn&#x27;t prompt the ability to add it to my calendar instantly. For the event hosts, purely design made it difficult to track guest responses - although they were using spreadsheet software, they had to manually follow up with guests or read responses sent back in texts. This meant inaccurate counts, leading to excess costs and scheduling headaches.<p>I realized this could be solved much easier if there&#x27;s a no-code builder for non-designers that adds web elements - like forms, buttons, fetches data, etc. In the recent past, I completed a consulting project for a course instructor where they wanted a simple website to maintain - instead of wrestling with the typical website builders out today. Combining these two use cases made me realize there&#x27;s potential for a big market, where small business owners&#x2F;designers want to create simple websites using the look &amp; feel of a design tool.<p>It&#x27;s still in beta, as I&#x27;m still in the customer development phase. It currently just works on desktop, not mobile.<p>For those interested in trying it out yourself, you can access the tool here:<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;woodblox.vercel.app&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;woodblox.vercel.app&#x2F;</a><p>Looking for any feedback, responses, sign-ups, etc.<p>Appreciate it!<p>- Bhavan",story,https://pageblox.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
