The password was a strong password stored in 1Password so I have no idea how it could have happened in the first place, but I guess that&#x27;s the second step to figure out. My guess is that there was some 3rd-party integration that was hacked and that lead to my account being hacked, but as far as I know, I haven&#x27;t used any 3rd-party integrations that could have that type of access to my account. My 1password account has likely not been compromised either, as only the Facebook account has been affected.<p>The problem is that this Facebook account was mainly used to run ads for a professional Instagram account, which now has also been suspended.<p>The hacker apparently has deleted the account (the account is not visible on Facebook anymore) and the email associated with the account was changed from a @gmail.com to a @hotmail account.<p>All the &quot;My account has been compromised&quot; or &quot;I was hacked&quot; support guides&#x2F;tools that Facebook offers, are assuming the email is still the same for the account, so I can&#x27;t seem to get any help from those.<p>Also, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way for me to actually contact Facebook support in any direct way, to get a human to help me.<p>So in short: How can a person who is literally giving Facebook money for a service get any sort of help with these sort of issues?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;m in my early forties and I&#x27;ve been working for the last 20 years or so as a software developer.<p>For the past 11.5 years I&#x27;ve been working for the same company, first as a permanent employee working on premises, later remotely as a contractor and now through a 3rd company. The last 2 scenarios are only due to tax&#x2F;legal reasons, for all intents and purposes it&#x27;s as if I was still a permanent employee of that company. It&#x27;s a non-tech company with a tech department of around 50 people, of which maybe half are devs.<p>I still have the same job title as when I first joined, senior software developer, and I haven&#x27;t led any team or had anyone reporting to me. My salary is roughly 3.5x of my initial salary (despite having never asked for a raise), well above market here. Still, I&#x27;m treated like an errand boy.<p>I feel bad when I see everyone around making progress with their careers. Meanwhile my only promotion happened like 15 years ago, when I went from junior to senior dev. My salary is, I bet, better than most, but salaries are secret. I&#x27;m concerned about ageism and who will hire me when I&#x27;m 50 and haven&#x27;t even led a small team.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how I can be so valued by the company in terms of money but not in any other aspect. I feel technically as competent as any other dev in the company (this is not a FAANG anyway), and I feel respected by my peers. I think I communicate well. I&#x27;m easy to work with, although getting grumpier by the day due to this situation (and age?). My bosses, including the current CTO, always say good things about me to the point of making me feel embarrassed when they do it in meetings with other people.<p>Some things that might play against me:<p><pre><code>  - I&#x27;m a backend dev, and the main product is a web page. CTO has admitted that hurts with visibility.
  - I&#x27;m working remotely. The CTO of the company is very vocal against remote work.
  - I&#x27;m technically not an employee as of the last few years.
</code></pre>
Other issues with this job:<p><pre><code>  - The CTO says I report to him (unofficially, being an external worker) because I&#x27;m important, yet I spend months without speaking with him. I feel bossless. And I think there&#x27;s little visibility of my work to work day.
  - Even though I have the opportunity to work on new semi-interesting projects here and there, I also have to maintain quite a bit of the old stuff that I inherited... I also have to do a shitload of reports (which I hate), as I&#x27;m the one with the better knowledge of the (decades old) DB.
</code></pre>
Here in my country we have a saying, would you rather be the head of a mouse or the tail of a lion? Well I feel like the tail of a mouse here. Because I&#x27;d fully understand being the generic code monkey #478758 at a FAANG company where everyone&#x27;s so good, but not at a small tech department after almost 12 years.<p>So I see two options:<p><pre><code>  - take a huge gamble, and quit my job in the start or middle of a recession, and having just had a baby (I&#x27;d make sure to land one offer first of course). Lose two thirds of my income, or half if I&#x27;m lucky, which we can afford as the house is paid for, we have no debt. No guarantee that I can make progress or be happier elsewhere, especially starting from scratch.
  - keep my head low, swallow the little pride I have left, and keep raking in the money. Learn some more frontend stuff that at least will keep me more employable. In a few years buy a beach house, that would help with my feelings, hopefully. My girlfriend and mum think this is the best option, money is just too good.
</code></pre>

I have worked all my life on the strategic business side of things. I have worked in growth &#x2F; marketing related roles and done everything from operational things like performance marketing and content creation up to leading marketing teams.<p>Also I have worked in consulting for corporates at a huge consulting firm and I have worked briefly in Sales at stripe (internship 2022 summer).<p>Last year I have done a coding bootcamp and became proficient in Ruby on Rails Web Development. I did it to better understand developers and product teams when I worked with them.<p>Now I feel more and more that I want to move towards programming as my main job.<p>And here we come to my questions
1) Has anyone here done a similar transition and can share their biggest pitfalls I should look out for? 
2) What resources can anyone here recommend to not just be able to program, but to understand it at a deep level (I often feel stuck in tutorial hell, where I can do what is shown to me, but don&#x27;t feel that I understand it well enough)
