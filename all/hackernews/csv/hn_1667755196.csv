I&#x27;m assuming they are investing in datacenters optimized for training large amounts of data on NVIDIA GPUs?<p>A few quotes from Meta&#x27;s Q3 Earnings report and call:<p>&quot;First, we are significantly expanding our AI capacity. These investments are driving substantially all of
our capital expenditure growth in 2023. There is some increased capital intensity that comes with
moving more of our infrastructure to AI. It requires more expensive servers and networking equipment,
and we are building new data centers specifically equipped to support next generation AI-hardware. We
expect these investments to provide us a technology advantage and unlock meaningful improvements
across many of our key initiatives, including Feed, Reels and ads. We are carefully evaluating the return
we achieve from these investments, which will inform the scale of our AI investment beyond 2023.&quot;<p>&quot;For 2023, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $34-39 billion, driven by our investments
in data centers, servers, and network infrastructure. An increase in AI capacity is driving substantially all
of our capital expenditure growth in 2023.&quot;<p>&quot;We believe the additional data center capacity will provide us greater flexibility with the types of
servers we purchase and allow us to use them for longer, which we expect to generate greater cost
efficiencies over time&quot;<p>&quot;Our AI discovery engine is playing an increasingly important role across our products -- especially as
advances enable us to recommend more interesting content from across our networks in feeds that
used to be primarily driven just by the people and accounts you follow&quot;<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s21.q4cdn.com&#x2F;399680738&#x2F;files&#x2F;doc_financials&#x2F;2022&#x2F;q3&#x2F;Meta-Q3-2022-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

And that Elon Musk&#x27;s takeover was just another case of &quot;One rich turd buying another rich turd&#x27;s company&quot;.<p>But judging by the amount of coverage it&#x27;s been getting in the press --and not just the tech press. I&#x27;m talking all the main news channels too-- I&#x27;m beginning to feel like everyone else but me seems to consider this the most newsworthy event of the year. Right up there with the Russian ivasion of Ukraine.<p>Only a couple of days ago, I heard an interview on a national UK radio news station with a soon-to-be-ex Twitter employee which seriously ran for about 20 or 30 minutes. And this was just some guy who worked there, speculating about the company&#x27;s future. Not a top executive or anyone with any real info.<p>And, as for the tech press. Well, it&#x27;s almost becoming a challenge to find a story which isn&#x27;t about Elon-bloody-Musk and Twitter!<p>Search on HN for &quot;musk twitter&quot;[0] and I counted 15 pages of submissions to go back 10 days to when the takeover was confirmed. At 20 results per page, that&#x27;s 300 submissions to HN alone, just in the 10 days since Musk took over.<p>In a similar period, the BBC has had 18 news stories on the subject [1]<p>And I counted no less than 60 stories on the subject in the Guardian, during the same time frame [2]<p>I&#x27;m assuming the story is pretty much the same in other parts of the world too.<p>Am I missing something here? I don&#x27;t see the fascination with social media myself. But I know a lot of people use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok or whatever and get enjoyment from them.<p>But are these vacuuous time-sinks so newsworthy that the change of ownership at one of them is attracting this kind of blanket news coverage. Can the press really find nothing  more important happening in the world?<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;query=musk%20twitter&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=story<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;topics&#x2F;cmj34zmwx51t&#x2F;twitter<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;twitter",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
