After sifting through the hyperbole from both sides, I made the decision to get vaccinated, in no small part to the people on this forum that had a greater technical knowledge of how mRNA works and the time it would take to clear my system.<p>My government agency is once again reaching out to me to get a booster and I feel it is time to revisit this question.<p>On one side I feel like &quot;In for an Inch in for a Mile&quot; and &quot;Who would the government really want to keep alive? The ones that get the jab or the squeaky wheels?&quot; but in the recent past, there have been several revelations of how the vaccine discussion and it&#x27;s efficacy was corrupted by big tech censorship and government politicization of corporate(and Public)media, our leader even made a joke about bribing them with 600 million dollars!(IMHO that was worse than joking about a gun in the airport security line, especially a handgun!!!)<p>I wish I could trust my government but over the last few years there are so many examples of at the best a misinformed leadership and at the worst an incompetent and willing to misinform me from my current government, and the controversies   started just weeks after they were elected. (I am sorry if my thoughts are unacceptable Justin and please don&#x27;t freeze my bank account Kristia!)<p>So please be kind and don&#x27;t interpret this as anything other than an;<p>Overweight, High blood pressure, 50ish year old smoker and drinker that is still concerned with taking my 4th shot even though I am the posterchild for Covid death.<p>Thankyou for taking the time to read my question, I look forward to your opinions, thoughts.<p>Some things I have not been able to find the answers to:<p>Has the virus mutated to a less deadly strain? (It is my understanding this is a common trait of &quot;pandemical&quot; virial diseases.)<p>Has there been any determination of: The truth regarding the sudden cardiac deaths of young males and if so is there any information on how the vaccine is related to this situation?<p>Finally, I have seen some very partisan videos showing people having facial paralyses and in particular difficulty opening one of their eyes.
Is this just BS or has there been any reputable studies done on this matter?<p>I am concerned that these questions and possibly many other more important questions and studies have not been done due to the stigma and possible cancelation of reputable individuals for asking and or answering these questions honestly.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
