And for many years now, no industry has heaped such rewards upon its workers as the tech industry.<p>Why would someone become a nurse when they could become a developer, and make more for less work while WFH? I am glad plenty of people are still choosing to become nurses, but I&#x27;m concerned tech is making the problem worse.<p>In fact, why would anyone pursue a career path other than tech, if money was the most important motivator?<p>Some developers might have been excellent doctors, nurses, or scientists, <i>despite chasing the money</i>.<p>The social value created by an average doctor or nurse is decidedly greater than that created by an average developer. Doctors and nurses diagnose diseases and save lives. Developers work on how to make mobile games more addictive, how to make more people click on ads, or on the next Javascript framework of the week, or the next Python library for which 635 similar libraries already exist.<p>Yes, I know I&#x27;m oversimplifying and relying on stereotypes. Many developers work on projects with tangible benefits for real people, but plenty also work on pointless projects or on projects that make society a worse place. There&#x27;s a grain of truth in what I wrote.<p>The quote “The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.” continues to resonate with me.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
