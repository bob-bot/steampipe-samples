Normally not a problem since it is a replaceable part. But we could no longer find the battery (or any of it&#x27;s recommended replacements) for sale on the Lenovo &#x27;genuine&#x27; parts store.<p>After calling with Lenovo sales, we got the answer &quot;we don&#x27;t sell those anymore&quot;, and the advice was to Google the part number of the battery to find a third party replacement.<p>Honestly, I am dumbfounded by this response. These are supposed to be &#x27;enterprise grade&#x27; computers. We bought them with extended warranty (batteries are excluded from extended warranty though). The last thing I want is a knock-off no-brand battery that can explode at any moment.<p>So in our (admittedly N=1) experience, a Lenovo laptop is a ticking time bomb. If the battery goes bad, you are SOL and you&#x27;ll either have to invest in a brand new machine, or take a risk with aftermarket batteries.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
