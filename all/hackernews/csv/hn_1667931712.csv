Its been a year since I am working on a chrome extension that focusses on securely sharing screen.
The pandemic took lots of businesses to remote work and screen sharing has been happening more than ever.<p>When we share screen, we are actually showing all the tabs, the message notifications, the apps we use and its like giving a picture of our whereabouts to everyone.<p>This thought or I would say the insecurity of sharing my privacy was the triggering point of creating ALLURT. I tend to share screen a lot and I spend couple of minutes making sure that the private tabs are closed and the bookmarks are hidden as I feel uncomfortable showing it to the world.<p>What ALLURT is offering right now,
1. Review tabs before sharing screen and close any single or all tabs except the current one thus saving your time that you tend to spend in reviewing the tabs.
2. Hide bookmarks automatically when you share screen and bring it back once screen sharing ends.
3. Put the browser in DO NOT DISTURB mode automatically to provide you a distraction free environment to present your work.<p>What&#x27;s next,
1. Customized features that you can set up according to the privacy you need for yourself during screen sharing.
2. A full fledged application that will cover many other platforms like zoom, MS Teams etc.<p>ALLURT is very useful for software engineers, sales persons and entrepreneurs. Most of our users are software engineers.<p>I am focussing on bringing in more features and users. Your valuable feedback (good or bad) would help me make positive changes to the extension.<p>Thank You.",story,https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allurt-secure-screen-shar/igfmiclefjlnfogddikkkllpnoanjhap,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We provide a headless EHR (electronic health record) that supports common standards like FHIR, HL7 and more. You build whatever UI and UX you want, and we handle the infrastructure and give you lots of interoperability and automation tools.<p>The digital healthcare space has been hampered by proprietary tech, walled gardens, and vendor lock-in. Working as healthcare app developers ourselves, we kept seeing organizations developing the same infrastructure over and over. The question “how is this stuff not open source?” came up so often that we finally decided to just build it.<p>Out of the box, Medplum includes:<p>- Auth - An end-to-end identity solution for easy user authentication, sign-in, and permissions using OAuth, OpenID, and SMART App Launch<p>- Clinical Data Repository (CDR) - A back-end server that hosts your healthcare data in a secure, compliant, vendor neutral, and standards based repository<p>- A FHIR-based API for sending, receiving, and manipulating data<p>- SDK - Client libraries that simplify the process of interacting with our API or any FHIR server<p>- A web application where you can view your data, perform basic editing tasks<p>- UI Component Library - React components designed to help you quickly develop custom healthcare applications<p>- Medplum Bots - Write and run application logic server-side without needing to set up your own server<p>Our team has years of experience in healthcare technology.

We make money through enterprise integrations, and by providing a hosted version and support. Compliance is a priority—we are SOC 2 and HIPAA compliant and are pursuing ONC and HITRUST. Our hosted service runs on AWS and uses cloud infrastructure similar to a typical SaaS application. This is also rare in healthcare.<p>We would love to know what you think - especially any recommendations or ideas you want to share, and would love to hear about your experiences developing healthcare applications!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

In short, we collect configuration data from APIs of cloud providers and 40+ SaaS tools. Main reason is, even properly knowing what you have in all those tools becomes bothersome quickly, we faced it hard with hyper-growth. We make it easy to collect this data, explore it various ways and create rules. Fully-managed.<p>Main features I&#x27;d like to higlight are:<p>* Run SQL: You can ask any question limited to your SQL writing creativity. You can query if a SaaS user exists in your IdP at all.<p>* Free text search: Search UUIDs, names, telephone numbers. You won&#x27;t believe what pops up.<p>* Relations: We automatically map relations between resources, even differnet tools. So your domain in Cloudflare might be poiniting an EC2 Instance.<p>* User discovery: Find out and group users in different tools. Did you really offboard people correctly? Or someone signed up with personal mail? And is MFA enabled on them, if it can?<p>* Managed Rules &amp; Queries: We have more than 650 rules and 1000 queries. Opening a marketplace for it soon. Coming from Opsgenie, we focus hard on to reduce alert-fatigue on issues by customizable notifications.<p>* Compliance Packs: Well known benchmarks to monitor your score over time.
* Integrations: Now 40, adding 3-4 per week. We want to integrate with all the tools a company might be using so we cover all your cyber-space.<p>Why we built Resmo? Because most security tools frighten people with fear driven sales (because, it works) and we want to reach in a friendlier, open-pricing, easy UX, and self-onboarding way, modern and smaller companies are used to. If you want to do more for security, using Resmo, upon connecting an integration, we offer visibility under 5 minutes, it&#x27;ll be likely a high return of investment, probably for free, or an affordable plan.<p>There are great open-source tools to do what we are doing. But we focus on ease of use, UX and getting most value in minutes.<p>Would love to think what you are thinking about it.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I don&#x27;t want to spam my audience either. Whenever I start one of these long posts I always get stuck re-writing, re-organizing and re-reading, and end up never publishing it.<p>I want a place where I can post stream of consciousness kind of thoughts on a variety of different topics. And a place where there isn&#x27;t the expectation of polish.<p>I guess what I am looking for is a way to publish my notes journal.<p>Twitter with long tweets seems close if they built it, but I would still feel awkward blasting out a bunch of thoughts to everyone. And there is still that feeling of proof-reading that feels like a barrier.<p>For code, we happily put out draft PRs in the open...so why not for blogs&#x2F;notes? We&#x27;ve got GitHub repos, issues, discussions.<p>I&#x27;d personally love to read people&#x27;s evolving thoughts on ideas in more depth. The best we get atm is Twitter, but its too short, and there is a hesitancy to post too much because it would annoy followers.<p>Anyone know any platforms&#x2F;tools for this kind of stuff?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
