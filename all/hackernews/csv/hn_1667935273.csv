33522566,Is Boxabl a Scam and Why?,2022-11-08T18:38:47Z,shanewarne,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I am a proud customer of Boxabl. I got my house a few years ago. I was very worried about how my experience would be at this ordered home from Boxabl. I have stayed in this house for some years now. I am enjoying my time with my wife and daughters. It&#x27;s really exciting and interesting at the same time. I love to live here. In my case, Boxabl is the most trusted company to invest in affordable housing. Before investing in any platform, you should know some factors about the platform. Boxabl absolutely is real. It seems that boxabl.com is legit and safe to use and not a scam website. You may see many scammers opening real estate farms and earning through fake investments. However, Boxabl is the more reliable company in the housing industry. I have mentioned some factors that will prove that the company is a legit platform.<p>Every housing company must have a license from the government. The government does not serve a license to any platform whimsically. The authority of the stage judges the platform with documents and liability. If they pass the following tests, the authority issues a license for the company. This platform has a license to do construction jobs. You can see the license on their official website. Go to the about option or check for the terms and conditions. You should get it.<p>If the company is offering scamming offers, how are they getting so much attention? They have a great portfolio. You know the portfolio of a company holds previous experience. If they did not do well, they would not get a great profile. In this case, Boxabl has earned a great profile. On the other hand, the support team works 24 hours to reply to the customers and investors. So, it&#x27;s easy to reach them right away.<p>The most important proof of this brand is the legal papers. You will find every legal document on the platform online. Here, you just need to talk to the support center. They will send an agent to your office directly with the legal papers. They don’t take money from strangers either. To invest with this platform, you have to be a legit citizen of the country. Later on, they will go with the formal process.<p>Although the management team is internal, I should mention some points in this section. I am a regular investor on this platform. The management team is very efficient to manage the resources and funds. They are very quick to make efficient decisions. I have seen some issues that they have solved quickly. If the executives are not professional, they would not finish the issues.<p>The well-being of a brand depends on manpower. It has enough manpower to deal with multiple construction sites at a time. They are very efficient and experienced to deal with every section of the construction site. I have seen their working capacity directly on the spot. They are seamless and dedicated to their work.
Previous works: When I came to invest in this platform, I checked their previous works. They were new in this field but they had enough of a portfolio then. At present, the brand has become a big company in the world. Everybody knows about them. They cannot be a scammer.<p>They inform their current clients about the present construction sites. As a result, anybody can check their activities physically. On the other hand, they are very transparent when dealing with their investors.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
