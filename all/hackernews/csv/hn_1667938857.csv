I used to send out screenshots in Slack and manually document analytics events as well as what APIs were hit. Other times, I needed feedback and final approval for what I spiked on. Worse, I was often blocked by missing assets or pending copy.<p>This was a huge pain and such a huge waste of time. Now I work on Literal which makes it incredibly easy to share a picture of the app flows to my team.<p>If you include the SDK as a debug dependency, you can record an app flow and get the analytics and network calls overlaid on screens. No manual screenshots or documenting needed. No messing around with Figma or Lucid either.<p>You can ping folks in Slack or Jira with some default integrations. This helped me avoid so many back and forth meetings. More dev time - yay.<p>Looking for feedback on the experience and how well the SDK works for you (Android &#x2F; iOS devs).

We also convinced CTOs from series C companies with millions of users to choose us over incumbents.<p>The typical bad symptoms at the time were: 
- Too many things under a single feature
- A feature from a competitor is discovered while our own feature is developed. The specification is changed to adjust the product positioning, while the engineers sit still
- Engineers uncover unexpected challenges during the delivery and the spec needs to be rewritten
