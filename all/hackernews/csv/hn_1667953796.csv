I&#x27;m very curious about how TubeBuddy&#x27;s &quot;Click Magnet&quot; https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tubebuddy.com&#x2F;clickmagnet determines impressions and therefore Click Through Rate for its users&#x27; videos.<p>Through the Youtube Data &#x2F; Analytics API, there is no way to view the impressions of a video, and as far as I can tell this is intended. My guess is that they use their chrome extension to scrape the Data, but I&#x27;m fairly sure this goes against Youtube&#x27;s Scraping policy https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;terms&#x2F;developer-policies .<p>I&#x27;m looking to implement this feature in my own application.
