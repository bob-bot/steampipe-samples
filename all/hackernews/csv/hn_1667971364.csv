The only reasonable step I see is splitting the app across two teams.<p>This must be the norm for large apps at large companies (I&#x27;ve never worked for one.) My current strategy is based on keeping one team over a core set of functionality. Then dividing the rest of the Views&#x2F;Services based on feature set across the teams.<p>Any resources on this problem would be appreciated.,story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
