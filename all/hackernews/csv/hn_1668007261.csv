I used to be a developer, and I thought it was ridiculous the little amount of bug repro details I would get in JIRA tickets.
Then I became a product manager, and I realized how time consuming and tedious it was to write good tickets for developers (and then understood why most tickets lack enough detail!)
That’s why my team and I decided to build a browser extension for anyone to create bug reports that auto-include: console logs, network requests, session replay, timestamp, url, browser, OS and device specs, and wifi speed.
With this extension, it’s faster than the old-school way to report bugs (a few clicks, plus no switching tabs). And, for the developer receiving the bug reports, it should be faster to debug because all the information is right there.
We started with a Chrome extension and soon we’re going to build extensions for other browsers too. (Which should we add next? We’re thinking Firefox).
We built this in react, typescript, mobx, and graphql. It’s privacy-focused: everything happens locally on your browser until you choose to share, and you can even select which specific websites you want the extension to run on in settings.
Today we shipped an integration with GitHub - meaning it’s now just a few seconds to create a really good GitHub issue.
I hope you check it out and I hope it helps bring about the end of bad tickets for you and your team! If you have any suggestions or questions, please let me know here!",story,https://jam.dev/github,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
