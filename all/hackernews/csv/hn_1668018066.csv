Can&#x27;t something be done about it?<p>The problem can be divided into two areas dependent on where the attacker-controllable variable is: the headers and the body.  Ideas for discussion:<p>Headers (only applicable where header compression is even possible - i.e. HTTP&#x2F;2 and above):<p>One option is just to never compress headers; they tend to be small compared with the body (and if not, the request is probably quite small and not that worth compressing!) - fine, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re already doing.  Alternatively, what about adding a random-length nonce to defeat the oracle?<p>Calculate SHA256 sum of all the other headers plus an ephemeral server salt (static for at least the lifetime of the server process and preferably also shared across all members of the cluster of webservers if applicable, to frustrate statistical nullification of the nonce).  Take the first x bits of the sum (say 4) and insert that many bytes of the end of the sum as the nonce as the final header.  Now we have an incompressible string of random length combatting the attacker&#x27;s attempt to elucidate the secret by checking the length of the compressed &amp; encrypted stream while altering their controllable content.<p>For example, say the salted hash of the other headers is 0xa647...1f93c430377b458ebf339b6, the first 4 bits are 0xa, so for this request&#x2F;response we will insert the last 0xa = 10 bytes as nonce header: &#x27;Nonce: 3c430377b458ebf339b6&#x27;.<p>Cons: Depending on the size of the secrets being protected, a size range like 4 bits (0 to 15 bytes) may be statistically insufficient to prevent attacks, so this would have to be a knob to tweak in the server.  If using larger max lengths, would need to securely extend the SHAsum (or switch to a variable-output-length hashing algorithm like SHA3) to give sufficient bytes for the nonce.<p>Body (as altered by the webserver or browser):<p>The body is more problematic, as there&#x27;s lots of different content types, but at least we can use declared mime types to decide whether &amp; how to handle each type.  Could follow the example of the above idea for headers and insert a sum-dependent-length nonce based on the body content - e.g. __http_post_nonce=3c430377b458ebf339b6 in a POST request, an HTML body tag &lt;http_nonce&gt;3c430377b458ebf339b6&lt;&#x2F;http_nonce&gt;, a js comment #__js_nonce=3c430377b458ebf339b6, etc.<p>Cons: Only works for content types the webserver can safely insert a non-functional tag or comment into.<p>Body (as altered by the service generating the content):<p>If we drop down from the webserver to the service layer, could insert a safety mechanism (like how you otherwise sanitise user inputs like SQL with escaping) around all user-modifiable content.  The mechanism tells the webserver layer to include the specified content without compressing it - e.g. mysecretlogincookie=__http_no_compress=291e36ab... in a POST request, #__js_nocompress on the end of a line containing a secret in javascript, &lt;http_nocompress&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email address: attacker-controlled@example.com&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;&lt;&#x2F;http_nocompress&gt; in HTML.  The webserver at the layer above would then need a mechanism to chunk compressed and uncompressed sections together in a way the other side could understand.  Tar?  lol.<p>Cons: Requires support both in the webserver (or browser) and whatever service is generating the content.  Whether the mechanism is used per-request could be negotiated with modified existing Accept-Encoding header - e.g. Accept-Encoding: gzip-safe, br-safe.<p>So, HN, (sh|c)ould it be done?

Metlo works by discovering all your API endpoints, running security tests, and detecting potential attacks. It runs before your APIs go into production, and also in real time, alerting your security team when anomalous usage patterns are detected.  Metlo secures your APIs against the OWASP Top 10 (broken auth, injection, excessive data exposure etc.) and more.<p>Although APIs are one of the largest attack surfaces in companies today, there aren’t many good security tools to protect them. The few tools currently on the market are “enterprise” only; they require you to talk to a salesperson to use, or even see, the product.<p>We saw a need for an open-source solution that could be self-hosted and where you didn’t have to talk to a sales rep to see the product. So we started building an open-source API security tool with an MIT license that you can self-host, fork, and generally do whatever you want with. Since not everyone wants to self-host, we also built a hosted offering that you can get started with for free.<p>Our website is at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metlo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metlo.com</a>, repo is at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metlo-labs&#x2F;metlo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metlo-labs&#x2F;metlo</a>.

This is especially useful for finding legacy, undocumented, and shadow endpoints your security team may not be aware of—a particularly nasty way to end up with vulnerabilities. We scan each endpoint for sensitive data (address, phone numbers, ssn, account info, etc) and assign it a risk score so you can instantly understand your highest-risk endpoints.<p>(2) Testing: Metlo runs a suite of automated tests against your API traffic and endpoints so you can find vulnerabilities before an attacker does. We find issues like unauthenticated endpoints returning sensitive data, no HSTS headers, PII in URL params, and many more. You can also write your own tests.<p>(3) Protection: Metlo analyzes ongoing traffic patterns and surfaces anomalous behavior so you can catch and shut down potential attacks in real-time. (This is not part of our open-source offering though.) Our ML Algorithms build a model for baseline API behavior and any deviation from this baseline is surfaced as soon as possible. Our UI gives you full context around any attack to help quickly fix the vulnerability.<p>We’ve tried to make it easy to set up and use Metlo (though deployment can still be easier and we’re working on making it so). You can self-host on AWS, GCP, etc. (should take &lt;5 min to do it) or use our hosted service at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.metlo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.metlo.com</a>.<p>We make money by charging for our hosted service, protection features, multiple users, SAML&#x2F;SSO, RBAC, audit logs, and support. As for pricing, here we’re a bit embarrassed because so far we have the dreaded “contact us” for our enterprise plan with some early pricing for others. That’s bad because, as mentioned, our goal is that you should never have to talk to a sales rep. However, we should have a “compare plans and pricing” page figured out in the next few months.<p>We look forward to hearing your feedback and ideas, and your experiences with API security, and are happy to answer any questions!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
