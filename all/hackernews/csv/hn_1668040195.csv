I studied bachelor of Engineering, with a major of product design. Which tends to cause a lot of confusion, but it&#x27;s essentially mechanical engineering and industrial design.<p>During my study, I worked at a company in the power industry for 2 years, where I got to invent and design new products- which is unheard of for an intern as they usually get grunt CAD work. Although I didn&#x27;t enjoy working with the company because of how they did things, I genuinely enjoyed my job, and got to work with my hands, create new things, and solve complex problems. I eventually got distinguished at what I did (generating lots of income and patentable designs) and surpassed some much more experienced co-workers in terms of coming up with new designs.<p>But this is where the fun ends. Firstly, there aren&#x27;t many product development jobs in Melbourne, and the ones that exist involve me moving out of the family home to the other side of the city resulting allocating a large portion of my salary to rent. Secondly, these jobs don&#x27;t pay much. In that specific company I had coworkers with 7 years of experience earning around $90k. So when I look at software jobs, I can find positions that are much less demanding (in job requirements and effort during work) than in my line of work, earning significantly more.<p>I&#x27;ve always been into tech, I have a home server, know decent python, docker, linux etc. But I&#x27;m at a crossroads, should I look into machine learning&#x2F;other jobs and hopefully enjoy the money? Or continue doing what I love (working on physical products)? I admit I&#x27;m naive and don&#x27;t understand both spaces fully. I understand that money is not everything, but I want to be able to afford a house and live comfortably.<p>A side question: What tech jobs can I look into? I prefer higher level thinking and planning like strategy, rather than focused development",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Chromium bugzilla must be the only bugzilla which requires reporters to give their phone numbers.<p>So if someone already has a GMail account, could they report the bug for me? Thanks.<p>Steps to reproduce:<p>1. Write the following four files under a single directory:<p><i>1.html</i>:<p><pre><code>  &lt;script&gt;

2. Run <i>python -m http.server</i> in that directory.<p>3. In Chromium go to &lt;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;[::]:8000&#x2F;1.html&gt;<p>4. See that the page displays &quot;1&quot;.<p>5.

See that the page displays &quot;esc&quot;.<p>11.
