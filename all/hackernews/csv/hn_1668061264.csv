I have validated the idea by surveying several potential customers. I am a potential customer myself. I have evaluated no-code solutions but I don&#x27;t think that will solve problem for my customers.<p>I have a budget of about $50K to spend on building the product. I suppose, I have following options
- Learn to code myself and build an MVP (Doesn&#x27;t appear to be a practical choice)
- Hire an outsourcing agency (or freelancer). Tell them my requirements and give them money. Looks practical one but have heard not so great feedback about this approach.
- Hire a few technical people myself and build the product.
- Find a CTO. Have tried doing it and failed.<p>Is there any 5th option which I am missing? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
