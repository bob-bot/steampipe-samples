I have an idea for a small hobby project that I am excited to give a go. But most of my knowledge is in C++, native code, and game development. I do use React and React Native, Typescript, and a few web based technologies at work but I am quite weak at them.<p>I&#x27;ve managed to set up a small react app(hello world) and deploying on Netlify at the moment on my own domain name.<p>However, there are a few other areas I am not sure how&#x2F;where to go. Some info:<p><pre><code>    * 0 financial transactions. 
    * Small scale only. A few hundred to maybe 10k users a day at maximum ever. Mostly US based. 
    * Need small amount of custom user posted data, such as them posting &#x27;entries&#x27;, containing 1 image and 3 sentences worth of data. Think craigslist but prettier? 
    * Basic account creation and&#x2F;or maybe using existing auth providers.
    * Typescript is a hard requirement
    * Modern approaches are ideal.
    * Mostly presenting lists&#x2F;tables with filters&#x2F;sorting. 5k-20k of unique data entries in lifetime of project. No big data needs here. 
    * Cheap&#x2F;free is best, but do have small budget.
    * Stretch: Eventually want to offer a few basic &#x27;pro features&#x27;, subscription handled via Patreon or something.  
    * No ads. No analytics. 
</code></pre>
I did see this post a while ago, but it goes into things I don&#x27;t think I have any need for. Such as I don&#x27;t need scalable big solutions, this won&#x27;t ever be big.
Not sure if these are still recommended?<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22354060<p>The biggest asks here<p><pre><code>    1. I don&#x27;t know what&#x2F;how to use for backend to store dynamic data?
    2. I am looking for some basic starter template&#x2F;things I can &#x27;iterate&#x27; on instead of starting from scratch.
</code></pre>
Searching for react starter templates seems riddled with &#x27;old stuff&#x27;, things that get pricey, big and complex fast, in javascript only(when I&#x27;d prefer typescript), or quite incomplete.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
