I am wondering if anyone here has successfully transitioned out of that and into something more interesting, but still technical. Can be computer science related or entirely different. How did it go? How far along in your career were you? Did you go back to school? Just apply for different jobs? Etc.<p>More about me: I am 28 years old with 6 years of industry experience and a computer science degree. I’ve been building web CRUD apps the whole time, even back in college. I consider myself a good developer and I’ve received lots of positive feedback from colleagues over my career, but I have lost all interest in commercial web development.<p>Besides the much-debated negative externalities of the modern web, at its core it just feels boring. It’s a solved problem. And the way most companies operate in the space is mind-numbing. Teams of web devs crank out endless tacky widgets at the behest of product and middle management. Confusing org structure makes any new initiative a headache. Hostility towards users is rampant and everything is optimized for SEO and ad clicks. Innovation, such as it is, just seems to serve the accelerating process of big companies eating the web alive and capturing control of it. It doesn’t feel fun or interesting anymore, and the thought of working on it for 20-30 more years before I can retire is depressing. The only reason I’ve stuck it out this long is the good pay. For some that’s good enough, and I recognize that, but I really don’t want to spend my one life on earth doing this bullshit anymore.<p>I know no job is perfect and burnout is its own thing I have to deal with, but having something new to learn about and focus on would help me, I think.<p>So, anyone have success stories of transitioning away from web dev into other technical fields? I would love to hear about it. Cheers!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
