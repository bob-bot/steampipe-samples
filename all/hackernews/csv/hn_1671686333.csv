I&#x27;ve been an avid user of telegram for 6+ years I&#x27;m online every day and have had many accounts over the years. Well I broke my phone I dropped it on a screw. And the screen shattered and was useless. I spent hours trying to get it to screen share to no avail. So I immediately went to Walmart and picked up a verzion prepaid sim and the cheapest phone. I put it in and tried to transfer my phone number. But I was unable to log into my tmobile account. I had the number for 15 years. Well I made the mistake of giving one of my ex&#x27;s ACCESS to my account. She had changed the password without me knowing and tmobile gave me no recourse. Customer service was useless as usual. Well I knew my friends contact info the main reason I stayed on TG I&#x27;ve known him for 6 years. Only reason I have&#x27;nt switched to matrix. He&#x27;s a ukrainian who&#x27;s in Kiyv with missiles raining down. Who&#x27;s seeking treatment for a brain tumor that&#x27;s likely to kill him. He can&#x27;t afford treatment. So I urgently tried to msg him but it wouldn&#x27;t let me. it&#x27;s. My account was limited WTF I just made it 10 seconds ago and have done nothing but sent him a single message. so I immediately filed an appeal. And as soon as I finished the appeal less than a second later I was kicked back to the log in screen. I entered my phone number and it said this phone number is banned. in the last 6 days I have sent telegram email support nearly a hundered emails and no response. and I have no way to ACESS my old account. Because I was only logged in on my old phone. And tmobile won&#x27;t give me my account number because my ex took control of my tmobile account. And without my account number I can&#x27;t transfer my number. I have no idea if he&#x27;s dead or alive he should of been through surgery now. So can you guys give stikyt with the black thing as his pfp 
a messege on Telegram. Make sure he&#x27;s okay. Tell him your asking for woodwere and link this. Maybe if he is alive I can come up with a altertive way to contact him. I know one thing Telegram is dead to me. Matrix and molly FTW.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

A great year of leisure, sure, but I attempted to figure out what to direct my life towards and failed.
Nothing came out of it. I don&#x27;t enjoy tech anymore, nor do I particularly enjoy any other fields of work.
