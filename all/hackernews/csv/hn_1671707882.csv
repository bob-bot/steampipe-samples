Now that the fest of love is near, I thought, I might be a bit more open, after ignoring and being mean to it for the past 3 years.<p>Do you know of any creative apps &#x2F; concepts using the touchbar?
They do not have to be useful per se, just a cool idea or concept. Also, if it is not an app, maybe just an idea you had in your mind, I&#x27;d like to hear it.<p>I will be buying a new laptop soon and it will for sure not a have a Touchbar (probably not even a mac). So I&#x27;d like to at least check, if I have just a missed a major opportunity to have some fun coming up with creative ideas for it.<p>The only thing I have seen that I found really, really cool, was the &quot;Samplr Touchbar app&quot;:

Maybe a concept that just didn&#x27;t work out but was a neat idea?<p>Don&#x27;t worry, I am not looking to become a &quot;Touchbar&quot; activist. Just feel there must be something to it, that not even apple could think of, that would be a cool use case.
