If so, did you do so from scratch, or did you use a tool&#x2F;library? Which would you recommend? Anything a new-ish dev should know while building a SCIM server?<p>I&#x27;m trying to build a SCIM (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simplecloud.info&#x2F;) server to handle user provisioning from various Identity Providers (IdPs; Azure AD, Okta, Workday, etc.) into our application.<p>I&#x27;ve familiarized myself with the SCIM spec (RFC 7642, 7643, and 7644). But, as a relatively new developer, I&#x27;m still on the fence about whether (1) to build our SCIM server&#x2F;API from scratch (in Java) or (2) to use a third-party tool&#x2F;library.<p>Right now, I&#x27;ve got my eye on Apache Directory SCIMple as a possible tool to use. But (1) it&#x27;s not on Maven Central yet and (2) it requires Java 17+ to build (and also for its spring-boot module), which might be a problem for us.<p>Maybe I just need to dive-in and start putting something together without relying on a third-party SCIM tool to do so. But I&#x27;ll admit that, again, as a new-ish dev, I still have the gut reaction that &quot;surely the stuff that other people have built is going to be better than what I can put together&quot;!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
