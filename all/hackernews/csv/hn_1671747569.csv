34099517,Show HN: Metriport – Open-source universal API for health data,2022-12-22T22:09:37Z,celsinga,6,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN, we’re Colin and Dima, founders of Metriport (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metriport.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metriport.com&#x2F;</a>). We help digital health companies access and manage user health and medical data, through an open-source and universal API. Today we&#x27;re launching our open-source Health Devices API, which allows companies to gain access to their users’ health data from various wearables, RPM devices, and mHealth apps. You can check out the public Github repo here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metriport&#x2F;metriport"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metriport&#x2F;metriport</a><p>For developers in the health data space, building integrations to various data sources is a huge pain, as it means wrangling different data formats, gaining access to the APIs in the first place, and ultimately spending precious developer resources building out data pipelines. We solve this pain for you through our open-source API, which is quick and easy to get started with (see: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metriport.com&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;connect-quickstart"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metriport.com&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;connect-quickstar...</a>).<p>Out of the box, our Health Devices API supports integrations with Fitbit, Oura, Whoop, Withings, and Cronometer.<p>With these initial integrations, we plan to add many more to this list, including Garmin, Apple Health, and Google Fit in the near term. We work very closely with our customers, so if there’s an integration you need that’s not currently on roadmap, we’re more than happy to add it and build it into our API. Because we’re also open-source, developers can fork our code and build their own custom integrations!<p>Getting started with Metriport is simple, and only requires a few steps to start getting data from your users:<p>1) Create a Metriport developer account and generate an API key. This can be done in the settings page of our dashboard: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dash.metriport.com&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dash.metriport.com&#x2F;</a><p>2) Setup the Metriport client on your server and initialize it with your API key. More on that here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metriport.com&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;connect-quickstart#3-setup-the-metriport-client-on-your-server"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metriport.com&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;connect-quickstar...</a><p>3) Link the Metriport Connect widget into your app. This pre-built widget makes it easy for your users to connect all their data sources into your application.<p>4) Get data - now you’re ready to start accessing your users’ health data from their sources they’ve connected!<p>We also offer a hosted SaaS solution with usage-based pricing, with no minimum platform fees. We believe this will open doors to a wide range of early stage companies and help drive innovation in the digital health industry.<p>While we’re excited to be launching this product today and be the first open-source Health Devices API of its kind, we’re also really looking forward to sharing our Medical API with you in the coming months. You can find out more about that here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metriport.com&#x2F;medical"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metriport.com&#x2F;medical</a><p>We can’t wait to see how this API is used and what new and innovative products and services it helps companies develop. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, and happy developing!",story,https://github.com/metriport/metriport,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

If yes what prompt you that you are the one suffering? During this day and age in Canada, the government cannot force anyone to receive treatments or to enter a mental health facility. One must realize that they are suffering from a mental health issue and seek help.<p>On one hand, two of my mom&#x27;s friends realized something was off on their end: They became extremely anxious to be by themselves at home and&#x2F;or could not function properly in their daily lives such as getting out of the bed. They went to their family doctors who transferred them promptly to the specialists. They knew that the prescription medication and the therapy have been helping them. In addition, they spoke to their friends such as my mom that mental health illness is real.<p>On the other hand, one of my friend&#x27;s acquaintance has not been unable not keep a job, has shown some delusional behaviour and had anxiety outbursts. My friend could not convince this person that, for example, they were the only one who &quot;saw a person behind the garden gate.&quot; They mentioned how someone have been following them. Lastly, they also mentioned how &quot;their family locked her up in a mental health facility&quot; but they signed the papers, left the facility and stopped taking the medications.<p>My friend and I called the local health unit&#x27;s mental health hotline looking for ways to help this person. The advice given to us was that we could only guide this person to go to a doctor voluntarily. Forcing someone to receive treatment would increase the trauma. Call 911 only if the person becomes a threat to someone&#x27;s lives.<p>We felt powerless as we saw her decline over the last 10 years.
