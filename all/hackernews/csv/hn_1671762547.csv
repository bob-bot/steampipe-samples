34101311,Ask HN: AI Bot for Posting Pro Chinese-State Messages,2022-12-23T01:32:16Z,mholubowski,2,false,false,1,[34101352],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey everyone,<p>We&#x27;re considering building an AI bot that can post pro Chinese-state messages on behalf of users at a regular or random interval. We&#x27;re interested in getting your feedback and thoughts on the concept.<p>The idea behind the AI bot is to allow users to increase their social score on Chinese social media platforms, which often use a &quot;social credit&quot; system to evaluate online behavior and determine reputation. By posting pro-government messages, users can potentially improve their access to certain benefits and opportunities.<p>Here are a few key points to consider:<p>The AI bot will be initially released to citizens outside of China, allowing them to hedge their bets and get on the good side of the Chinese government.
We hope to eventually release an open source version of the AI bot for adoption in other markets.
The AI bot will be simple to use and can be set up to post messages at a frequency that&#x27;s convenient for the user.
We believe there is a significant total addressable market for our AI bot, and we&#x27;re looking for feedback and interested investors or team members to help us bring it to market.<p>We&#x27;re also considering a few potential domain names for the AI bot. Here are a few ideas:<p>SocialCreditPro.com
SocialScoreBoost.com
ChinaGoodSide.com
ProGovMessages.com
SocialScoreGenie.com<p>Technical Architecture (ready for feedback):<p>- functional programming to build a scalable, concurrent system for handling a large volume of pro Chinese-state messages.<p>- language like Elixir or Haskell, which support immutability and allow for easy reasoning and maintenance.<p>- distributed database like Cassandra or Riak will store the data and allow for horizontal scaling.<p>- message queue like RabbitMQ or Kafka will manage message flow and enable decoupling.<p>- Machine learning and natural language processing will generate the pro Chinese-state messages.<p>- We&#x27;ll use a serverless architecture, such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, for hosting. This enables demand-based scaling and reduces infrastructure management.<p>The resulting system will be modern, scalable, and easy to maintain and extend.<p>Let us know what you think, and please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out if you have any feedback or are interested in investing in or joining the venture. - Mike",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
