34102604,Ask HN: Is structural editing considered mandatory for Lisp?,2022-12-23T05:31:06Z,HexDecOctBin,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I recently tried using Lisp (CL and Racket) again after college, and ran into a problem that doesn&#x27;t really seems to find any mention in books and evangelising blogs.<p>All style guides seem to agree that in Lisp, all closing parenthesis should be put in the last line of code (instead of stacking theme line-by-line C style). However, if you do this, and then want to add more code after the last line, you either end up having to move cursor to correct location by counting parenthesis (usually augmented with editors&#x27; matching paren highlighting functionality); or just delete all the closing parens, add your code and add close all of &#x27;em again. Both are tedious ways of writing code.<p>Looking around the internet, the &quot;solution&quot; I find is to edit the Lisp code structurally through editing in whole s-expressions. This seems yo imply that if I want to write Lisp without pulling out my hairs, I need to first learn a new way to edit code and only then go to actual programming; not to mention that always being stuck in the constraints of sexprs would inevitably be too..., well, constraining.<p>Is this true? Is learning Lisp should really be preceded with learning structured editing? And if so, how come no learning material or style-guide ever mention this practical hurdle?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

A few weeks ago, they started showing up a day later. After weeks of trying to get support to track down this bug, we finally got this response<p>&quot;Thank you for your patience while my team looks at this. We were able to confirm that the best time range currently to space the blog posts is 10-12 hours before Mailchimp&#x27;s sending time. There just isn&#x27;t enough time between your posts and the feed to pull the new content.<p>As a best practice, I would plan your content releases a day in advance with this functionality in mind.&quot;<p>It started with 4 hours, now they are telling us 10-12 hours in advance? My client runs a news site and sends our daily news. It&#x27;s not always possible to even publish content that far in advance. It&#x27;s insane to me that this functionality was working fine, for years. That they have managed to break and instead of fixing are saying just publish an insane amount of time ahead of the newsletter being sent?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what it takes to get someone&#x27;s attention at MailChimp to actually fix this.
