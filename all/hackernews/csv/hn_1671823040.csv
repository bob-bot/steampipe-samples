A year ago, I wanted to build a chrome extension that would reveal the HN score of the website I am reading. A legitimate approach would be sending the site URL to HN search and then getting the score. That&#x27;s not desirable as that leaks all my reading history to a 3rd party website.<p>I came up with the idea of building it in the opposite way. First I created compact indexes (via bloom filters) of HN articles with scores of more than 400. Then I created a cron job to create such an index every day. Last, I made an extension that downloads the index and then checks the history locally.<p>The end outcome is that there is no history leak to 3rd party site.<p>The extension has been working well for me over the last year, and I would like to share it and also get feedback.

We had just missed an event earlier in the week and I would have totally missed this one if not for him reminding me. I told Harish how this was a pain for us and others like us. Others like us needed to be at these startup events to be part of the ecosystem of the customer, founders, and investors.<p>Harish agreed that it was a pain and something we faced every day. We said why not &quot;solve&quot; it over it the weekend. Put it up on PH and see what happens.<p>We put together a simple Airtable. Harish would update with events coming up, and I would automate this with the calendar. We spent last weekend on it. I read a ton of articles on &quot;How to&quot; do a PH launch. I learned that Tue-Thu are good days to launch. Most of them suggested a 2-3 month prep. But we had given ourselves just that weekend to built and a day to launch. Also, we decided to hunt ourselves. We did not think this was big enough to ask someone to hunt for us.<p>We prepared the PH page, a Gumroad store to sell the calendar, and prepared a few paragraphs that we could post. At 12am on Monday (Tuesday morning) we launched on Product Hunt. Check it out here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;the-essential-founder-calendar<p>We had made a list of groups that would be active at different time zones. We started engaging those groups, some at 12 am, some early morning Tuesday, and some Morning to noon PST.<p>By the end of the day on Tuesday, we were at #16, got ~85 upvotes, and had 6 sales @$120&#x2F;- per year. That&#x27;s $720&#x2F;-. Not bad I would say for a weekend of work. This was our first-ever PH launch and learning what it takes to launch made it worth the effort.<p>A few things we learned
- If you want to try something out, just launch the damm thing
- Launch on PH does not end with hitting the submit button it starts there, you let your network, groups, and individuals know you launched. You engage in discussions and you watch the action. Its a full day of work.
- Hunters can really help push the needle for the first upvotes so they do matter a lot. But you can still launch without them.
- You get votes and sales after the launch day too.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
