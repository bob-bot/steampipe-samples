I don&#x27;t have to go to three or four team retros and sprint planning meetings or write multiple status reports, outside of (usually) tightly scoped work on specific cross-functional projects.<p>But for instance, as a tech writer in a company that has more engineering teams than writers, each writer gets embedded in multiple teams — participating in sprints and retros, reporting status, helping plan features alongside UX and product, and working on tickets alongside engineers. I might also be regular part of marketing, support, and product discussions.<p>In the worst cases as a writer, I&#x27;ve had to juggle working across multiple project management paradigms — one dev team&#x27;s using waterfall, another&#x27;s hardcore Agile, another&#x27;s ad hoc, all using different sprint&#x2F;work intervals — while also fixing time-sensitive problems raised by people who can&#x27;t directly fix issues themselves, writing or editing blog posts for marketing as a SME, and juggling release&#x2F;ops demands around release dates.<p>Prioritizing work becomes fraught without a central way to report what I&#x27;m doing, for whom, and when, and orgs like this are typically in this state because its engineers are understandably its top priority, and the engineers are often against changing any of their working process to standardize under anything resembling cross-functional project management.<p>Most tools and tactics for prioritizing incoming work requests feel like they&#x27;re either designed for people who have just one workstream to focus on, or for teams who can delegate cross-functional work. As a one-person team, then, how do you work effectively across multiple workstreams, all of which are organized differently?<p>Do you advocate for more common processes that might help everyone coordinate work better? Are there tools or tool uses that are particularly effective for cross-functional work? Do you communicate pain, and if so, to whom and how? Do you automate tasks ruthlessly, and on teams without someone technical enough to automate things themselves, how do you get engineering help or budget to implement and maintain it?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
