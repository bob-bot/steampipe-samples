I&#x27;m posting from a throwaway, but I&#x27;m not embarrassed by my ask so maybe I should have used my normal login. Also I apologize for the wall of text I&#x27;m about to write.<p>The question I&#x27;m struggling with: what should I do next in my career?<p>The context: I&#x27;m in the midst of a minor career crisis. Not because I don&#x27;t know what I want to do with my career, but because I&#x27;m paranoid about closing doors too early.<p>I&#x27;ve had a somewhat less traditional career arc to this point. I joined a FAANG company straight out of college as a software engineer. I found some success early and got promoted after a little over a year. I spent the following year as a SWE before role changing to a product manager because I wanted to be closer to customers. 2 years later I was promoted to a senior product manager and stayed in that role for another year before making the switch to an engineering manager. I was an EM for 1 year at the same FAANG company before switching companies to a series C startup for the last year where I&#x27;ve been EM for a team that grew from 2 to 10.<p>I&#x27;ve made the decision to leave my current company for various reasons and I&#x27;m grappling with what&#x27;s next. I think I&#x27;ve had success in each role I&#x27;ve been in, but I realize I&#x27;m a strange candidate for EM roles even though it&#x27;s the role I love and believe I&#x27;m best at. I&#x27;ve had recruiters tell me as much in the last two weeks. I&#x27;ve also had a hiring manager screen where the first question the HM asked me is &quot;are you technical enough?&quot; I&#x27;ve never received feedback that I&#x27;m not technical enough, but now I&#x27;m nervous.<p>My fear is that my odd job arc has eliminated me from most traditional EM roles that want (totally understandably) 6+ years of software engineering experience. What I&#x27;m grappling with now is whether I should take a hiatus from the EM role and try to return back to a software engineer role for a few years to build up that part of my resume OR whether I should keep forging ahead trying to find an EM role.<p>My hang up on pursuing a software engineering role (besides loving the EM role) is that my technical imposter syndrome is now through the roof. I&#x27;ve been away from hands on engineering for 5 years now and I&#x27;m fearful that I would fail on the job.<p>ALL of this to say: has anybody made the transition back to a software engineer after years away? And do people think I&#x27;m going close a lot of future doors if I don&#x27;t bolster that part of my resume in the near term?<p>I welcome any and all advice.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
