Another wish of mine was for it to be a web extension that feels native to the browser vs an app extension that looks out of place.<p>I posted a while back on HN to see if other people feel the same and the response was very positive : <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33811253"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33811253</a><p>Say hello to TapTab : <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;apple-store&#x2F;id1659363738?pt=66324801&amp;ct=hn&amp;mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;apple-store&#x2F;id1659363738?pt=66324...</a><p>TapTab feels right at home in Safari and is loaded with features to improve how you interact with tabs. You no longer have to miss the native tab-switching functionality that you love in Chrome&#x2F;Firefox.<p>I launched the app a few days ago, and the response has been great. Some of the features that users have been loving :<p>- Keep your hands at the keyboard: navigate all tabs without your hands leaving the keyboard.<p>- Fuzzy Search: Search through your tab titles and URLs at lightning speed.<p>- Switch to previous tab: Comes with a handy shortcut to go back to the previous tab. Finally!<p>- Dark Mode: The extension feels right at home in Safari.<p>- Multi-Window support<p>- Pin&#x2F;Mute&#x2F;Close tabs right from the extension.<p>The app is written in ReactJS (apart from the very minuscule bit of Swift you have to write for using it as an extension in Safari) and uses Tailwind for design.<p>If you are one of the dozen people like me who use Safari, let me know how you find it. I would love to hear if there are any features that would make it a better fit for you. I have a few things on my radar gathered from talking to users like an iPad version, custom shortcuts, etc.<p>If you find the extension useful I would love it if you vote for it on Product Hunt to get this in front of a few more eyeballs : <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;taptab"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;taptab</a><p>Thank you!",story,https://www.taptab.dev,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
