There are only two famous people named Zora.<p>On the other hand, you could deny that &quot;famous&quot; has any specific standard, and there are a lot of people on this page:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zora_(name)<p>It would be extremely easy to avoid agreeing with my personal definition of fame, for a human.<p>It replied:<p>Zora Neale Hurston: Zora Neale Hurston was an American 
 folklorist, anthropologist, and author who was a key figure in 
 the Harlem Renaissance. She is best known for her novels 
 &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; and &quot;Moses, Man of the 
 Mountain,&quot; as well as her work as a folklorist, collecting and 
 preserving African American folktales and oral histories.<p>Zora Arkus-Duntov: Zora Arkus-Duntov was a Belgian-born 
 engineer who is known as the &quot;father of the Chevrolet 
 Corvette.&quot; He played a key role in the development of the 
 iconic sports car and is credited with introducing many of the 
 design features that made it successful.<p>Zora LaVey: Zora LaVey was an American burlesque dancer, 
 model, and actress. She was known for her exotic dance 
 routines and her appearances in films and television shows in 
 the 1950s and 1960s.<p>So I wrote: Is Zora LaVey a fictional character?<p>And it replied by affirming they are a real person, and regurgitating the paragraph above, with some slight embellishments.<p>But starting a new session and asking the same question produces: &quot;It is not clear who or what you are referring to with the name &quot;Zora LaVey.&quot; There is no widely known public figure or fictional character by this name. It is possible that you may be mistaken or that this person is relatively unknown or obscure.&quot;<p>Among other things, it seems to me significant that while it seems &quot;good&quot; at BS&#x27;ing, it didn&#x27;t BS by choosing an actual person who was on the Wikipedia page and explicitly or implicitly disagreeing about who is famous. There is some general principle of how it works that captures this behavior, I feel certain. Obvious if it were stated clearly.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
