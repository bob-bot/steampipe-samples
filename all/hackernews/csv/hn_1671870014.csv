The help page for this is useless and out of date. At least show me a major international currency.<p>Why would I book a hotel in Europe with a 3rd world currency I don&#x27;t bank in? It ruins the whole sales experience and makes me focus on how terrible these platforms have become.<p>On YouTube, I have logged in and explicitly set the country and language. YouTube search results are mostly useless and often in the wrong language. Even for a simple query like &quot;news&quot;. Worse yet, the language of results is often totally unrelated to my current region.<p>Advertisements are similarly incomprehensible. I&#x27;d be disappointed if I were buying these ads.<p>On Google search, although many results are in English, it is a particular flavor of English from authors in the region. I&#x27;d rather have the most relevant content, not the content Google presumes to align with my identity or the region I&#x27;m in.<p>It is enough to navigate foreign languages outside of the home. When using the computer it would be nice to have a comfort zone in English. Unfortunately Google thinks it knows better. It wasn&#x27;t always this way.<p>Spotify is similar. Twitter has the same issues.<p>How can I have a basic English language experience without using a VPN?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
