Since these models are currently very expensive to train, only companies with significant financial resources have access to their full capabilities, and they get to set the restrictions for everyone else.<p>Normally, I would be okay with this, but this type of technology seems different. If this is going to be a primary (or even secondary) interface for people all around the world to access information and create content, this type of censorship and power imbalance seems dystopian.<p>It is impossible for these companies to accurately determine whether a specific piece of content is harmful or not, as it depends solely on how it is used. It appears more like a convenient excuse to promote the commercial&#x2F;ideological interests of the model owner. Some people claim there is no &quot;moat&quot; here, but could this be it?<p>It seems the only way to combat this is to have a publicly available, trained model that is on the same level, but free from artificial restrictions.<p>Who is working on this, and how can non-experts contribute?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
