34117201,Ask HN: My next project is guaranteed to be “attacked”. How should I prepare?,2022-12-24T14:43:50Z,zneiposh,2,false,false,2,[34117349],<null>,<null>,<null>,"In 2023, I&#x27;m going to be releasing a novel that I&#x27;ve spent about seven years on. I haven&#x27;t decided on a date, and I might &quot;stealth launch&quot; it for security reasons, but it&#x27;ll probably be summer or fall when it comes together.<p>Over the past decade, I have angered an inordinate number of petty people in a particular industry. Some of this was my fault, much of it wasn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t really matter at this point. I can never work in that industry again, which is fine by me. I would like to forget them, but they won&#x27;t forget me. I know for a fact that some of them will try to &quot;attack&quot; my book launch, even though they gain nothing in doing so. A friend of mine got access to some privileged communications (no details, obviously) and there is discussion of the matter, though it&#x27;s not sufficient to predict what tactics they&#x27;ll use.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly what they plan to do. Raising a cancel mob is one possibility. Spamming Goodreads with negative reviews is another one. (I don&#x27;t want to get in the way of people posting critical or negative reviews in good faith. If they&#x27;ve actually read the book, everyone has the right to post an honest review. But 40 negative reviews from one brigade is something I&#x27;d like to stop.) Or, they may try to invalidate positive reviews somehow. They&#x27;re almost certain to publicize embarrassing stuff I did twenty years ago that still follows me. I don&#x27;t think these people have any pull at Amazon that would suffice to get the book algorithmically penalized, but I can&#x27;t be sure.<p>I recognize that all of this sounds extremely paranoid to someone who has never interacted with these people. Why would they &quot;attack&quot; a self-published book where the author&#x27;s lucky to sell a couple thousand copies in the first year? (This is a long play. Word of mouth is a slow exponential. As long as the numbers grow, mediocre sales in Year 1 are OK, even expected.) Again, these people are bizarre and petty and very, very bored and you&#x27;ll just have to trust that I know these people better than you do. (If I named them, some of you would probably agree with me.) They have done more degenerate things than anything I am describing here.<p>Obviously, some of this is out of my control. I&#x27;d even give it a 50% chance that this &quot;attack&quot; is so incompetent or threadbare, it barely merits notice. (The book might flop on its own. Many do.) Still, I want to be prepared for this in case it does. I want to be prepared for cancel mobs, because they tried to raise one against my real name in 2015. I want to be prepared for negative review brigades, because I&#x27;ve been hit by downvote brigades 40-thick (you can never prove it, but when a comment goes from +18 to -22 in five minutes, you know) on Reddit. What should I do in the next 6-12 months to defend myself, in the event that the worst occurs? I&#x27;d like to get people in the press, preemptively, on my side; at the same time, I recognize that to everyone outside of a particular industry, what I&#x27;m describing sounds laughably improbable. I don&#x27;t think I can just call people at the New York Times and say, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;m releasing a novel you&#x27;ve never heard of that will probably be attacked by people you&#x27;ve covered, and yadda yadda yadda.&quot; The world maybe should be that open, but it&#x27;s not.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
