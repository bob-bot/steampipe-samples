This directly benefits you and all Earn users. Your support and understanding has allowed us to focus entirely on advocating for you and the return of your assets — it is truly appreciated.<p>If you have not already agreed to the new MLA and you do not agree to be bound by it, you should not access or use Gemini and you must send an email from the email address registered with your Gemini Account to customer support at support@gemini.com within 7 days, saying that you do not agree to the new MLA.

Users are assigned a numeric user id that does not leak any Telegram user info.  The messages you send are not private as they are accessible to other users via the bot or via the &#x2F;context command.<p>You can also send the bot a url to inject a summary of the url’s corresponding text into the current context.  Use the &#x2F;context command to see the entire current context.<p>Currently there is one global chat context of recent messages from other users, but I plan to scale this by using an embedding of the user message to dynamically assemble a relevant context via ANN query of past messages, message summaries, and url summaries.<p>There are several motivations for creating this.  One is to explore chatting with a LLM where the model is presenting some partial consensus of other user’s current inputs instead of the model’s background representations.  Another is to explore dynamic prompt contexts which should have a lot of interesting applications given that GPT seems much less likely to hallucinate when summarizing from its current prompt context.<p>Open to PRs if you are interested in hacking on this in any way, or feel free to DM me @ wskish on Twitter or Telegram.",story,https://github.com/jiggy-ai/mass-gpt,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
