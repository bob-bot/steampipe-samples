I would like to get your opinion on it. To be totally honest and clear, I have no budget for either of those projects. I am willing to put my time into them and to be patient even if it takes years.<p>1. Gay adult project<p>I am gay and have pinpointed what bothers us in the gay community and what can be improved. It is a gay hookup site but with a significant major improvement. I think that could really improve the hookup scene in the gay community. I have no business model or way to monetize it at this moment. it is a location-based so kinda hard to market because I have to promote it city by city. I do have some adult followers on my Twitter and I started to write the blog. Here I know exactly who to target and who needs this service. Just not sure how to target those people, but I have some ideas.<p>2. Mainstream project<p>This is a mainstream project with a clear business model and earning plan. It is not location-based, everybody can jump in and participate. One side pays while the other side gets paid. Here I don&#x27;t know how to target an audience, I have some ideas. This one is either &quot;it goes viral or it doesn&#x27;t&quot;. I don&#x27;t really know if people need this or not, but I know that people want to earn money, while other people want to pay someone to do something or to see someone do something. This project is technically well-defined, but business-wise not so much, the purpose is not really clear for me.<p>If I may, I could share landing page of each project so you could get a better idea about what it is, my description here could be vague
I&#x27;m not here to talk about the features of each project or competitors, I&#x27;m here to get advice on which one I should pursue.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
