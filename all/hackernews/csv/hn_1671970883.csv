We got into an accelerator. I worked as the technical cofounder for three months until we raised millions of dollars from top venture capitalists. During that time, the CEO had me work 100 hours a week building features for the company. On the first day of work, he called me a crackpot. I’m a black woman. He criticized my appearance and my voice. He went through my emails. He attacked me every day calling me crazy. If I hadn’t done good work for the company, we would have never raised millions. At the end of the three months, he and his partner tricked me into giving my shares away after realizing that he was going to lose control of the board.

34126303,Ask HN: Help. Startup rejected by YC because I chose to live in Ukraine. Anyone?,2022-12-25T11:29:07Z,igammarays,15,false,false,<null>,[34126485],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN, my name is Isa Hasenko, and I am the founder at Fintable.io in desperate circumstances and I need help. A very small amount of money ($20k) would be enough to rescue me from bankruptcy and allow me to continue growing a very promising startup. In return I am willing to give equity, a lifetime SaaS subscription, or consulting services. I&#x27;ve exhausted all other options, borrowing from my parents, asking my largest clients, nearly maxed out my credit card. Although I am at $5k MRR, profitable, and growing slowly, there were a number of unexpected expenses due to the war in Ukraine this year that put me in debt.<p>Actually what I need more than just money is tech mentorship. YC would&#x27;ve been fantastic, but apparently I&#x27;m not cut out for that. I was interviewed by YCombinator last year. I got the feeling that I aced the interviewed and impressed the panelists, except for one question: why did you choose to live in Ukraine? They thought I was crazy and lonely for doing that, and the rejection letter subtly pointed that out.<p>I am Canadian-born, homeschooled, and ethnically Sri Lankan, but I chose to live in Ukraine in 2019 because I love this country, and feel a great sense of community and camaraderie over here that I do not feel anywhere else. I picked up the language very quickly. That was before the war, and war has only further highlighted the Ukrainian spirit. When the war started, I have friends over here who were willing to risk their lives to pick me up during heavy fighting on the streets of Kharkiv (I had a comment on HN about it at the time [1]). These people are like family to me, and I would never leave them. They invite me to dine with their parents and relatives, because they literally consider me to be part of their family. (And no, I do not have a romantic partner here, in case you were wondering. My girlfriend and stepson fled to Germany and we are separated by distance and time.)<p>During the Battle of Kharkiv [2] (Feb 24 - Mar 12), I was there for two weeks in an underground shelter, still answering customer support emails, shipping code, and taking feature requests. All while under heavy fire from Russian airstrikes and artillery. The ground was literally shaking underneath, but I was on my laptop, and my neighbours were taking care of me by checking on me regularly, sharing homecooked food with me, etc. I fled back to Canada after that, but returned to Kharkiv because I love these people. I now live in Kyiv, but I travel to Kharkiv regularly, where I volunteer at MissionKharkiv.com, a registered NGO. In Kyiv I was recently given a house right next to the Office of the President, under 24&#x2F;7 military watch, snipers in the rooftops, President Zelensky&#x27;s motorcade passes by regularly, and electricity is guaranteed, so I can continue to work. As long as the lights stay on, I will continue to work here and help the country as much as I can. If the lights go out, I will head out to the Kharkiv countryside or the Mission Kharkiv bunker, where I have friends who have farms with generators and Starlinks.<p>Are there any investors out there willing to take a risk on the crazy ones? Or cofounders in Ukraine? I have a much bigger vision for Fintable than is currently visible on the website. I&#x27;m building a global bank API to take on Plaid, and I will fix the reliability&#x2F;security problems with Plaid. Hear my pitch (its confidential), and I&#x27;ll show you what I&#x27;m building.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30453538
