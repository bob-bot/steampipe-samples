He wanted to provoke an emotional reaction from him that way, ending his <i>totally innocent questions</i> in &quot;C&#x27;mon buddy!&quot;.<p>Apparently there had been an architecture diagram (that Hotz had shown) outlining the mammoth architecture of twitter. Just naming random items from that diagram would not have helped anyone, except Brown&#x27;s ego. IMO, that&#x27;s why there was laughter, because Browns questions were not only confrontational, provocative and manipulative, but also pointless.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that everybody participating in the discussion was aware how refactoring or rewriting in such a big product works and what the problems are. Musk (and it doesn&#x27;t matter if it was him directly or people working for him) does have an idea how to refactor; he successfully refactored the way we had been building rockets for decades.<p>You can hear that he wanted to start answering the part of Brown&#x27;s questions that actually made sense and weren&#x27;t solely provocation (skeleton rewrite vs back to drawing board), when you hear the &#x27;click&#x27; when Musk realized that all that Brown wanted to do was to put him on the spot. That&#x27;s when he correctly identified him as a jackass.<p>Brown does sound like one of those manipulative&#x2F;toxic workplace people you should stay clear of.<p>Everybody just latches on to Musk, because they&#x27;re not thinking neutrally, they hate him, for whatever amalgamation of reasons, assume he is a jackass and idiot - and then find their <i>proof</i> for it.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
