I feel the best way is to insert a *BLANK* page after each *TEXT* page (by saying text page simply means any page with texts), use an e-pen to hand-write in the BLANK page while circling&#x2F;labelling contents in the TEXT page. I can probably insert the blank pages using a Python script but I&#x27;m not sure which e-pen and writing board I should purchase for my laptop (Lenovo T-460S). I believe handwriting is the only fast, reliable way to take long notes.<p>*Issue 2*: How to effectively take notes for *technical textbooks not in my field*? I just completed the nand2tetris hardware part and had no other training in computer engineering, so the Mick Bit slice book is much more advanced. But at least the opening 20% of each chapter is very well accessible so I only intend to read those parts. I hate to admit, but I actually don&#x27;t know how to take effective notes in a non-academic environment. There are two questions bugging me:<p><pre><code>    1- When should I take notes? Taking them too early, then I found myself erasing previous notes frequently. Taking them too late, I found myself forgetting previous contents frequently.

    2- How much note should I take? The book is for advanced users so I have to evaluate a lot of Boolean logic by myself. Should I include all of them in notes? Should I copy down a lot of contents from the textbook into notes?
</code></pre>
Afterthoughts: Maybe at the age of 40 I still don&#x27;t know how to study effectively. This doesn&#x27;t surprise me, as back in university I tended to gloss over details and proofs and grab for good marks (I did get 3.7+ in both undergraduate and master). But now this is a hobby so I want to stop cheating myself. If anyone (especially someone who struggled with the same problems) can point me to a resource to re-learn how to study I&#x27;d appreciate the help. I learned about Pomodoro Technique but it doesn&#x27;t suit topics that need hours of focus.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Why normal size and not a paper that is microscopic or paper the size of the earth?<p>Something common about these choices was that they were done subconsciously, kind of automatically, and you didn&#x27;t consciously choose the properties of paper.<p>The subconscious mind does this automatically, if nobody makes a conscious choice.<p>For example, if the original question was &#x27;imagine a red piece of paper&#x27;, then the choice was consciously made by someone, and then you would have imagined a red piece of paper.<p>Or if you had stopped for a minute, given it some conscious thought and made a creative decision, you would have chosen maybe a blue piece of paper or some other color, who knows.<p>Rule 1 - When you don&#x27;t make choices consciously, your subconscious mind makes some choices for you, without your involvement.",story,https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Normal-Again-Developing-mindset-ebook/dp/B0BHR7RBJZ,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
