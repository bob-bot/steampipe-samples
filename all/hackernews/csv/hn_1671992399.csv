I am well rounded in many aspects (more so a jack of all trades type [Full stack]) although I feel like I know nothing, which I hope is a normal feeling as there is unlimited knowledge to gain in the industry.<p>I have remained in an operations style position because I am able to work on small personal projects that make my job&#x2F;life easier.<p>I have boosted and buffed my resume to the best of my ability (without flat out lying, lol) to say “I have quite a bit of experience”, while also saying I don’t have experience in certain aspects (teams, meetings, anything involved in a programming specific environment).<p>I have some good certificates I’ve grabbed just to show ability, I will soon begin to pursue a security cert or two as I have interest in the area. My major experience is in commercial sales, operations and service management.<p>I know there is more a could mention but would love to hear any available insight from industry professionals based on what I’ve provided.<p>Thanks, HN pals.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
