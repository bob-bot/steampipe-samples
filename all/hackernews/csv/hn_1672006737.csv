The photos were stored on the device directly, unfortunately not on an SD card or on a cloud provider. The phone does still turn on (it vibrates when plugged into a power outlet and shows up on Windows). However, it&#x27;s only showing an installer for HiSuite (which did not help), not the file system. USB debugging is enabled.<p>Things I tried so far and didn&#x27;t work:<p>- shining a flashlight at the screen to see if only the backlight is broken (it seems the whole screen is done for)
- eyeballing it and trying to blindly enter the passcode
- connecting phone to external monitor and keyboard via USB-C -&gt; HDMI (monitor stays black)<p>Is there anything that may still have a chance of working short of replacing the screen to unlock the phone? Thanks and happy holidays.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
