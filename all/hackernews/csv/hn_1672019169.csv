34133352,Ask HN: Hacking Facebook account seems easy in Vietnam,2022-12-26T00:57:58Z,ebfe1,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"This problem probably extends to other countries like India(that i have seen people complained about in support) but in the last 1 year, I had 2,3 friends who had their accounts compromised, one of them had a really interesting case where she was able to briefly get her account back by a different &quot;hack facebook&quot; service but then got taken back. I saw no trace of them backdoor her login email accounts, she even went to the extent of replacing the login email with brand new email (after removing the attacker&#x27;s phone number and email addresses and since the attacker replaced primary email with his, it was possible for him to recover it back again.. these guys wven instructed her to add at least 10 new emails to her fb account (i guess to push the email of the attacker out of the list of &quot;previously used email&quot;. In the end it was all for nothing as the account was taken back. Note that she even had sms otp.<p>With that said, one thing im actually suspecting is the login via phone number because in Vietnam, ISP operator is so dodgy, I have heard of cases where ex boyfriend working in phone company stalking their gf sms etc..<p>Or perhaps there is another widespread account take over vulnerability that is actively exploited at the moment?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
