The volume of information available online has become almost unimaginably immense. According to the World Economic Forum, in 2019, Internet users posted 500 million tweets, sent 294 billion emails, and uploaded 350 million photos to Facebook every day. Every second, the Internet transmits roughly one petabyte of data: the amount of data that an individual would have consumed after binge-watching movies nonstop for over three years.<p>The amount of digital data stored on hard drives cannot grow forever. Hard drives have limited space, and data centers cannot grow their footprint forever. Rare earth metals used to fabricate hard drives are a limited resources, as is land, and the electricity needed to power data centers.<p>Given the exponential growth of digital data, I think it&#x27;s time for tech companies that host large amounts of data from the public to start implementing data destruction policies.<p>A few hypothetical examples:<p>- YouTube: All videos that are over five years old, have less than 5k views, and belong to an account with less than 1k subscribers shall be deleted.<p>- Twitter: All tweets over 3 years old with less than 1k likes and not uploaded by an account with a blue check mark will be deleted.<p>- Facebook: All accounts that haven&#x27;t been logged into in at least one year will be deleted.<p>- Image hosts like Imgur and giphy: any upload older than one year that receives less than 20 views on average per day will be deleted.<p>Etc.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
