But this year, they&#x27;re available for cheap (I got mine at 70% off MSRP) and the hardware has glowing reviews and there&#x27;s now Dustbuilder support [1].<p>The rooting process was exceptionally simple. Next to the dustbin, there&#x27;s an UART port to which you connect one of those $5 USB to UART converters (3.3V model). I&#x27;ve painted the pinout I used in [2].<p>$ sudo screen &#x2F;dev&#x2F;ttyUSB0 115200,ixoff<p>Press the reset button... and you have a root login prompt. Calculate your password according to [3] and you can now do backups of the nand with dd+curl and install a patched firmware like [4] to add an SSH server.<p>By now, it should work with MQTT and 3rd-party miio apps without any internet connection. As a last step, you can install the excellent Valetudo open source web-GUI [5] which, BTW, is React+NodeJS so easy to customize to your liking.<p>And now, everyone in the house can remote-control the vacuum robot just by opening a website :)<p>The Dreame W10 that I use also supports multiple floors through miio commands, so I patched my Valetudo installation to support that. Just never ever mention multiple floors to the Valetudo team, because they have a very strict policy that everyone who doesn&#x27;t own a single-floor penthouse apartment must be an idiot ^_^<p>But overall, the rooting process was easy, didn&#x27;t require any disassembly of the robot, didn&#x27;t require any obscure tools and now I can ssh into root on the robot and it doesn&#x27;t have any internet connection and works just fine. Also integrates with Home Assistant, if you fancy that.<p>Happy Christmas hacking, everyone!<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dontvacuum.me&#x2F;robotinfo&#x2F;detail_dreame.vacuum.p2027_0.html<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;TwfdMxT<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;builder.dontvacuum.me&#x2F;dreamepassword.php<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;builder.dontvacuum.me&#x2F;_dreame_p2027.html<p>[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;valetudo.cloud&#x2F;",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
