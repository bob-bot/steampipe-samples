I was able to remove my phone as an authentication mechanism for this account.<p>Now after reporting the incident to the carrier, I am in the process of trying to remove this phone number from other financial accounts and have been met with the following scenarios:<p>- Easily switched to a different phone number verified only with the last 4 digits of my SSN. (Which feels ways TOO easy, IMO.)
- Website allows doing it, but fails with an error when attempting it.  Customer service lines are closed.
- Website does not allow removing it without a verification via SMS to the stolen phone number.  Customer service lines are closed.
- Website login does not not have a 2 factor workaround that will prevent me alerting people who have stolen my phone number that I am trying to access an account that they might not be aware of.<p>None my investment accounts seem to allow third party 2FA.<p>I am left awe struck with how poor industry best practices are and also how vulnerable we can quickly be made with a loss of access to a phone number and email address.<p>Is anyone aware of financial providers (specifically banks and investment brokerages) out there that have sensible security measures and incident response?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
