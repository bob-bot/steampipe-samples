34140592,Ask HN: Resources for learning/teaching time zone conversions and datetime math?,2022-12-26T18:56:22Z,solardev,3,false,false,1,[34140596],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Does anyone have recommendations on tutorials, videos, lessons, etc. to better understand time zone conversions and datetime math and be able to teach it to a general audience (a mix of coders&#x2F;managers)?<p>At work, we frequently have to deal with time zone conversions between a user&#x27;s browser time, the timestamps in our backend databases, and the user&#x27;s saved time zone in their profile.<p>Sometimes all three these can be different, and there are daylight savings time and leap year considerations too. This causes confusion for my coworkers and myself, and is the source of many small but gradually-accumulating bugs.<p>My coworkers have requested that we try to better understand and teach each other these intricacies, but it&#x27;s a topic I very much struggle to explain and&#x2F;or visualize. I&#x27;ve tried discussing it verbally, making paper timelines that you can move around and overlap, and writing some demonstration code about edge cases, but it&#x27;s still not simple to grasp. Does anyone have recommendations for better teaching materials on this topic?<p>I&#x27;ll provide some examples of the difficulties in a reply, but TLDR there are a lot of edge cases we have to account for, and I&#x27;m not at all sure I&#x27;ve accounted for them all. Many of us don&#x27;t realize these are issues and so never code for them until there are already a bazillion entries in our databases, so it&#x27;s harder to change now and we don&#x27;t want to do it unless we&#x27;re sure we can get a better implementation right.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
