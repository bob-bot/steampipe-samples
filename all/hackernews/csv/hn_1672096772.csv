For example, one might had looked at the price history and saw their house had increased $100k in value from the time of purchase up until Jan&#x2F;Feb of this year, whereas looking at the estimates today, that same time period now shows only a $20k gain.<p>So if lets say 2020, house bought at $300k, was estimated at $400k by Redfin in early 2022. Today, Redfin now says the price estimate for the same home in early 2022 was actually $320k, not $400k as actually shown earlier in the year.<p>I know price estimates are just that but I&#x27;m curious to know if anyone else has noticed or what you might think of something like this being altered after the fact?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
