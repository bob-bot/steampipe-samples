My impression is that folks in my generation are increasingly leaving or ignoring social networks and, after roughly a decade, have concluded that they aren’t helpful or interesting to them as a concept  (perhaps outside of special domains such as professional networks or dating). They still stay in touch with groups of friends via messenger apps.

I have in the past done some only video tutorials on YouTube to help teach some coding frameworks or some other concepts. It is fine and all but I&#x27;m really just trying to focus better on getting the info out of my head, rather than fight the tools to make a better presentation.<p>I have a little bit of background in graphic design but I tend to obsess over the details. I&#x27;ve used kdenlive in the past and while it&#x27;s cool and powerful it just takes a lot of extra time. If I had my choice, I&#x27;d rather pick a template that has some graphics, a font, and some other details picked out where I can just upload content, mess around for a short bit and them push it out there into the world.<p>The ultimate goal, I suppose is to help other developers learn some new concept. I mean it&#x27;d be great to get to a zillion subscribers and buy houses in Malibu, but since I&#x27;m not planning on that happening, I just want to teach other developers what I&#x27;ve learned. It will also help me use the videos for others at my job as reference to teach certain concepts. By me teaching, it also forces me to deepen my skills so I don&#x27;t sound like a moron in the videos!<p>I suppose the goal would be an online editor (I primarily use Linux as my desktop). I&#x27;ve looked at Canva and Adobe Express which probably seems like my answer, but just wanted some opinions from others with more experience than myself.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
