34143802,Ask HN: I prefer single letter variables,2022-12-27T01:12:42Z,techsin101,6,false,false,8,"[34143989,34143902,34143867,34143860,34143949,34143890]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"So it&#x27;s almost universally accepted variable names should always be descriptive, consistent, etc... but I&#x27;m sure there are scenarios where single variable names are preferable. I can&#x27;t quite formulate solid parameters of when that is, but here is a try:<p>- There are few variables in the whole code block &lt; 5.<p>- Amount of lines is &lt; 25.<p>- Code is very functional in nature. ie. no a.getObj()<p>Sometimes I appreciate good variable names and sometimes I hate descriptive variable names. Short var names might be better where extra effort required to parse long names is not worth in terms of utility gained.<p>One example: variables are not meant to be used for long term just exist for next two lines....<p>i.e. filteredData = arr.filter(...) , noDateFilteredData = filteredData.filter(...), noNameDateFiltered = noDateFilteredData.filter(..)....<p>this would be easier to read when it&#x27;s written like this<p>a =  arr.filter(...), b = a.filter(...), filteredData = b.filter(...)<p>another situation...<p>data = arr.filter(n =&gt; n.flag === true);<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; it&#x27;s completely obvious what&#x27;s happening here, n is iterable. calling it obj|arr|users|etc... doesn&#x27;t add much value for this piece of code as is. you probably already know we are getting users. It&#x27;s like not using pronouns &quot;he&quot;&#x2F;&quot;she&quot; and just keep using first name: Mike wanted to come in because Mike had said that Mike needed to talk to Aniqa, Aniqa knows about the insurance stuff. Aniqa has worked in insurance....<p>There is inverse correlation between length of a variable name and the speed of understanding logic of the code. But smaller the name the more you need to remember what it is, and the longer it&#x27;s carried over the more difficult it&#x27;s to continue remembering it. So in situations where it doesn&#x27;t need to be carried for a long time I prefer smaller names.<p>I&#x27;m sure of it from my experiences. I prefer short names generally when is less data massaging and more algorithmic in nature, because sometimes it&#x27;s hard to name a var in a way that captures vague concept in algo, without making it downright misleading. i.e. i call something a sliding_window but then later don&#x27;t use it as one. Reader would be like um... wait what??<p>TLDR: I guess correct name matters more and more, the farther you are from its declaration.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

These two audiences have only minimal intersection.<p>I get decent engagement with the former, but not with the latter. For the former, I have a lot of my colleagues and people in the circle following me, which helps. For the latter, I haven&#x27;t built the audience yet. Based on the followers and engagement it feels like my Twitter is a &quot;work Twitter&quot;.<p>I also feel weird about posting about my blog to my work Twitter.
