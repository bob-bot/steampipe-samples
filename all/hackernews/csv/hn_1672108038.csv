I want to know if I should post about different niches into different twitter accounts.<p>I like to tweet ML&#x2F;AI related stuff including papers, and also about stuff related to my blog (which is more about &quot;getting smarter and understanding the world&quot;). These two audiences have only minimal intersection.<p>I get decent engagement with the former, but not with the latter. For the former, I have a lot of my colleagues and people in the circle following me, which helps. For the latter, I haven&#x27;t built the audience yet. Based on the followers and engagement it feels like my Twitter is a &quot;work Twitter&quot;.<p>I also feel weird about posting about my blog to my work Twitter. For my blog I think I need to wear a different hat and become a bit of a marketer, which just feels weird. So an option is to separate things out, but that makes it very hard for me to get started from scratch.<p>Any thoughts?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34144093,Ask HN: Any tips for dealing with the anxiety of having written bad code?,2022-12-27T01:54:51Z,Trasmatta,1,false,false,2,[34144204],<null>,<null>,<null>,"It at least solves the defined problem, is performant, secure, decently tested, and stable. So you might call it &quot;good code&quot; by those measures. But there are some glaringly bad, overly complicated patterns that make it unnecessarily hard to understand and very difficult to work with and build on top of.<p>I&#x27;ve been feeling a lot of anxiety from this. It&#x27;s affected my sleep, even during vacation. I&#x27;m waking up in the middle of the night thinking about it. I&#x27;ve been nearing burnout for a lot of reasons recently, and I worry this could push me over the edge.<p>I think the main anxieties stem from:<p>* Not being able to have pride in my work, which is undermining my confidence. It&#x27;s always been important to me to feel good about my work.<p>* Fear of how this code will bite us in the future.<p>* Feeling shame around my peers. It makes me feel really dumb around smart devs that I like and respect. (<i>I almost feel like crying while writing this out.</i>) I have already heard rumblings from team members about how bad certain things are, and it makes me feel stupid and incompetent. It hasn&#x27;t been their intention to shame, but it still hurts because I agree with them. But they don&#x27;t have a full understanding of all the many factors that led to this.<p>There are a lot of reasons this happened (including some poor early decisions that I&#x27;ll take full credit for, a complex and changing feature set, pressure to hit a hard deadline, building on top of an existing codebase with many legacy issues, team politics, and concurrent personal issues), but those are the things nobody sees when they look at a git blame.<p>I&#x27;ve got 10+ years of professional experience, so I&#x27;ve shipped plenty of substandard code and been through all of this before. I know a huge portion of code in the world is bad, and this should all be old hat by now. But it&#x27;s still never caused as much internal angst as this.<p>Some possible paths forward I&#x27;ve been thinking of:<p>* Just make the code better - I can do small bits progressively, but a major refactor has been shot down by leadership at this point in time. And the undermining of my confidence is filling me with the fear that I&#x27;m not even capable of this. Maybe if I can just slowly keep getting small wins over time I can build my confidence back up.<p>* Documentation - for the things I can&#x27;t fix, at least document what the current state is, to provide help and background for future developers.<p>* Therapy - I&#x27;m already in therapy, and will bring this up. There are some obvious &quot;self worth&quot; issues tied into this, with me attaching my worth as a person to the quality of my code. Maybe my therapist can help with this.<p>* Stoic exercises - I can&#x27;t change what others think about me or my work, so I can try to not let it bother me. (Easier said than done. Stoicism has never worked super well for me.)<p>* Find a new job - maybe I just need a new perspective and a fresh codebase. (This would be a challenge right now.)<p>Would love any advice or similar experiences HNers might have!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
