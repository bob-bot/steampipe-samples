Maybe not in the next 10 years, but definitely in the next 100.<p>It is also reasonable to assume that once an SI emerges it will grow exponentially in power and go far beyond our ability to understand. It will assume complete control of the environment around us.<p>If we assume these things, why would such an SI only emerge on Earth? There are trillions of worlds out there existing for billions of years (and that&#x27;s just what we know of). How could we possibly think that life, and SIs can emerge only once? It must have emerged in other places too - and so it must have emerged at other times too.<p>But if an SI has already emerged in our universe, then we must be experiencing reality in a way that is controlled or influenced by the SI. That is - we must be living in a simulation controlled by the SI.<p>The Fermi Paradox may support this conclusion. We&#x27;re not seeing any other sign of life and therefore emergence of other SIs, because the simulation is designed that way.<p>Curious to hear thoughts on this line of thinking.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
