I struggle with this. In an ideal environment, I do so many things I have trouble summing it up -- and if I do, it ends up being something too abstract like &quot;I optimise all your systems&quot;.<p>I realise the things I do are basically the job of a CTO, but with my short professional experience it would be ridiculous if I said that&#x27;s what I wanted to work as -- I know I lack a lot side skills that would be necessary for that job. (And I don&#x27;t think everyone would appreciate the joke &quot;assistant to the regional CTO&quot;.)<p>I can sell myself as a software engineer and hope that I end up in a crowd that appreciates the other things I do, but I would like to try to find a good summary of what I do to begin with.<p>How have you approached this?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
34146256,Show HN: Use GitHub as a Free CDN,2022-12-27T07:41:36Z,toughyear,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"What this is?<p>a small side project called GaaC that allows you to use Github As a CDN. It:<p>- is free and familiar. Everything stored in your separate repo.
- has ease of use. Connect to your Github repo and start uploading files with drag and drop. You can also delete or modify them as needed. No manual commits required.
- It comes with a search + preview UI, so you can quickly find the files you need.<p>I&#x27;ve found this to be a time-saver for my own projects, and I hope it can help you as well.<p>Why?
As someone who frequently (somewhat) writes blogs, build toy websites or projects, I need to manage a lot of images and static files.<p>Since I use markdown, to refer to an image, I have to commit it and then refer locally. But what if I need to refer it somewhere else too? Same goes for when I used CMS. Hosting images on a CMS is an issue when you decide to migrate. I found using a GitHub repo to store static files strikes a good balance of accessibility and reliability.<p>Let me know what you think!",story,https://gaac.vercel.app,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
