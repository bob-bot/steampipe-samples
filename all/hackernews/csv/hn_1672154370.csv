At first, my colleagues seemed really nice. The CEO appeared charming. There were some red flags in the beginning like how he talked about screwing over other people to get ahead, but I ignored that because I was naive and accepted his offer to join the company.<p>Here are four things you should look for when joining a company:
- have you vetted your boss and colleagues - I usually ask my boss questions to make sure that he isn’t a bad guy. You’re not the only one being interviewed, you should be interviewing him too.
- how long have your future colleagues been at the company - the toxic company I worked at had a cutthroat boss who fired easily. He seemed to enjoy making people work like crazy and screwing them over some way some how. Even though I was the cofounder, I lost some of my shares. Thankfully, I hired a lawyer to avoid losing the rest.
- How is your boss treating you? There’s no excuse to be treated poorly. Because I was so naive, I thought it was ok for the CEO to yell at me and go through my emails. After I left, he continued to do the same to other employees. In fact there was an article written about how bad it was working there.
- Are your colleagues collaborative? I’ve worked at companies where my colleagues loved to talk bad behind peoples backs. It’s not cool.<p>There’s no perfect working environment. Every job has its perks and downsides. Sometimes you have no choice but to stay and try to make the most of it. I decided to leave, but I was able to do that because I was young and I had a great education that opens a lot of doors. Today, I work for a fortune 100 company and I’m doing well.<p>Don’t like the toxic company get to you. If you can leave, leave. It’s not worth the psychological abuse that you will go through. I felt like I was gaslighted and it took me years of therapy to get through it.<p>Don’t ignore the warnings signs.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
