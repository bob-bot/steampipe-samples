I’ve myself played around a bit with it, but felt it was annoying to always have to log into their GUI to ask the questions.<p>To scratch my own itch and at the same time learn more about how to write my own command line interface, I created &#x27;askai&#x27;. &#x27;askai&#x27; is a simple CLI integration with OpenAI’s GPT3 models. I’ve primarily used it to get quick answers to technical questions, like:<p>&gt; askai &quot;How to mock user input when writing a Python pytest test?&quot;<p>&gt; askai &quot;How do I remove a conda environment?&quot;<p>As I&#x27;ve found it quite helpful, I decided to spend some time to package it in a nicer way to share it with all of you. I&#x27;ve also uploaded it to PyPI to simplify the installation process.<p>&#x27;askai&#x27; enables you to:<p><pre><code>    * Ask questions and get the answers straight into your terminal

    * Configure which model and model parameters you want to use

    * Overwrite saved configurations when you ask questions
