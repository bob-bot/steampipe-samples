Worked at FAANG, small and large startups. I left my last job bc I really believe that I can start a company and it&#x27;s really one of my life goals to do so. Sounds cliché but fast forward a few months and I&#x27;m having some expected turbulence.<p>I&#x27;ve tried a few MVPs and while the MVPs got less than 100 users, I got demotivated about them because it seems like for every idea I have there&#x27;s already a startup that&#x27;s doing something very similar (if not the exact thing) - and is super well funded or positioned. Because I&#x27;m trying to figure out &quot;the unique&quot; angle for the startup, I&#x27;m also having a hard time attracting a co-founder.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to navigate my current situation.

I have also learnt programming this way mostly programming them myself with my own interest.<p>But, I want to get a programming job by next year to sustain myself. I have applied to many places, many startups, many companies and so on. I have avoided top companies which ask leetcode problems because i am not so good at leetcoding.<p>I approached one company and gave me take away home problem. I spent hours on that problem trying to make it very good. Even though i did it well, they rejected me abruptly telling that I am not good. Ironically, they hired another person to whom I had told about the company and they had asked him same problem which they solved in exact way i had solved before (also,i had told them about problem).<p>Another company calls for the interview, then when interview is over tells me that No suitable roles are available.<p>Another company gives me Take away home problem and doesn&#x27;t reply after i submitted my solution.<p>And there are many other companies to which I have applied. Some responded, some didn&#x27;t but I didn&#x27;t even get any success.<p>I am hopeless right now because My Job Search is yielding no results and also because I have received lot of rejections. I have invested hours building the project they ask and they reject me and now I feel that I have wasted my time too. I don&#x27;t think I am skill-less too. I am totally confused, HNers, and I feel hopeless.<p>Regarding the skills, I know Backend Development in Java,Go , Frontend Development in React, Svelte(this is my fave), also Vue.I also know few other tech like Postgres, Redis. Plus, I have also developed Open Source Android App in the past and know basic Kotlin. Now, I am studying Rust too, having done few personal projects(axum is my favourite web framework).<p>Anyway, If you have any suggestions, please tell me.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
