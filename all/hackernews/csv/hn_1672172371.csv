It is a marvellous book that talks about tech, management and ultimately, people. But one particular rule stands out:<p>&gt; They believed in the rule of pinball: if you win, you get to play again; but failure is unthinkable, so you&#x27;d better let no one get in your way.<p>I can relate. I believe in the axiom that I should pour into whatever I love to do, 70&#x2F;80&#x2F;100 hours a week, and don&#x27;t worry about financial rewards because they will come along eventually. In all of the gigs I worked for and am working for, I had&#x2F;have to create mini pinball machines for myself because one rarely gets what one loves to do.<p>In this respect, I completely agree with people who re-invent wheels, who do NOT do things &quot;the boring way&quot;. Work is boring already, and pinball machines are rare. One has to find some fun by oneself. This, of course, leaves unforeseen consequences, or are they really unforeseen?<p>It is therefore important, and beneficial for managers to create sort of a pinball experience for the team. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a real pinball machine -- I mean, it doesn&#x27;t have to be <i>the</i> most exciting thing. In fact, as the book states, the Eagle was actually a boring product to build. It is the atmosphere created by West and other executives that ultimately motivates the whole team and made the experience memorable. It was not the $$ rewards (no stock option), not the product (a boring machine), but the freedom -- sometimes frightening that drives the pinball machine.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
