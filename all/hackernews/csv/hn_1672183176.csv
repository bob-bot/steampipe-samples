For me, the precipitation timeline was a view I was heavily relying on for everyday activities and planning. I had not found any replacement from the various weather apps. When I found pirateweather.net as a backend API, it gave me the motivation to put the pieces together and get back the experience I enjoyed. I then added more functionalities that I think was missing from the website such as a weekly chart view. I&#x27;ve been using the website reliably over christmas holidays.

I have come to realize that there are no good all-in-one applications to notify me of sports events that I like to follow! Till now I had been either manually adding matches to google calendar with notifications (not to mention that for the matches that were usually at night, I had to setup separate day notifications for them) or pretty much downloading separate apps to follow when events related to that sport were about to happen.
I have come to a conclusion that there might be some scope for development here and want to validate if anybody else would be interested in an application to solve something like this? Basically, I have been thinking about working on a mobile app where you choose your favourite sport at setup time (can further narrow down to maybe teams if need be) and it would notify you when a game related to that sport is going to come up. It would also keep track of your timezone, so when the game is at night in your local time, it would notify you a couple hours earlier, just so you can attend it if you want to.
All that said, do you thinks it a worthwhile problem to solve? If yes, would you be interested in paying for it? Any and all feedback is welcome.<p>Note: It&#x27;s probably not the biggest problem to deal with but personally, having an application like that will probably save me a couple of hours every now and then XD.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
