There are certainly some that one could argue would be different though I think its fairly correct based on titles alone.  I&#x27;ll also note that there are some different results when I was working in a smaller sample size - the entry &quot;Added 49 volumes of Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee law&quot; was classified as &quot;US politics, Current Events&quot; rather than &quot;Unknown&quot;.<p>I do want to note that isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> bad.<p>Running this:<p><pre><code>    &quot;prompt_tokens&quot;:560,&quot;completion_tokens&quot;:222,&quot;total_tokens&quot;:782
</code></pre>
So, this is just a hair under $0.02 to do.<p>Thinking about it, some cleanup can be done by removing the year and media type which could trim a few tokens off the request.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
