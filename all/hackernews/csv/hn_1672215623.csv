34158529,Ask HN: How to build a loyal audience that pays?,2022-12-28T07:37:10Z,ugur2nd,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I have developed more than 600 products. But since I don&#x27;t have a paying loyal audience, I&#x27;ve been constantly starting over to brand.<p>Then I thought of branding myself and started to produce content on the area I wanted to focus on. I set my domain as Micro SaaS. First, I share the Micro SaaS pictures that I create every day on Twitter. I create the pictures myself. I&#x27;ve been posting for a week.<p>I have a Micro SaaS-focused blog. I am sharing my knowledge. Because I had previously installed Micro SaaS. I aim to build 4-5 Micro SaaS in 2023. I might even sell it on Micro Acquire.<p>Regardless, the main issue is the loyal audience that buys. Do you think the path I&#x27;m on is the right one? Do you have any extra suggestions for this trip? Thank you.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
