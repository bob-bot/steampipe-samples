The case study was, if I recall correct, filling in web forms and searching for apartment rentals fitting specific criteria, which is initiated by a simple text prompt without any additional tweaking.<p>It was not an assitant in a sense of Alexa or Mycroft, but some kind of an automation. I may be mistaken here, but it may have also come in a form of a browser extension. The showcase demo was most likely either a video or a gif.<p>Could anyone kindly remind me what exactly the product was and provide a link to the HN discussion?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Then why do almost all introduction to CS courses teach programming in the fancy popular language of the time?<p>Shouldn&#x27;t introduction to CS be all about learning principles of the discipline in a broad perspective which then branch out to several specialised subjects later on?<p>And shouldn&#x27;t introduction to programming be a separate course that teaches the way to program to achieve some concrete goals like building something?<p>Example: Wood carving techniques are taught to learn how to carve a piece of wood to build a small sculpture or something. Not to teach the principles of wood carving to become a master wood carving artist. Those things are separate.,story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
