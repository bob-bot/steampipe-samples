I have several hobby projects stalled because I just don&#x27;t manage to progress without making an unworkable mess.<p>I realize the question is somewhat open-ended, but what I am looking for might be something like walk-throughs&#x2F;discussions in REAL semi-complex applications. Something that approches actually designing an application together with a mentor.
Everything goes: books, talks, youtube-channels, podcasts, ...<p>For example, in a complex text-editor:<p><pre><code>  - how to read and pass input
  - store and update buffers
  - where should syntax highlighting happen and where should it be rendered, how is colors passed to renderer.   
  - How do one design a plugin architecture
  - How would one design for multiple GUIs
</code></pre>
I know how to do the small stuff like actually reading input.<p>I am <i>not</i> looking for the usual design-patterns, refactoring pieces, language tutorials, etc.<p>What I have tried:<p><pre><code>  - Actually coding, but as I said, I just can&#x27;t progress on my own.
  - Kilo&#x2F;Hecto editor tutorials, and other projects, I&#x27;m unable continue beyond finishing them.
  - Reading code, I can&#x27;t even reason about my own code, let alone others. 
  - Books, the usual recommended ones, refactoring, design patterns, pragmatic programmer, Domain driven design (can&#x27;t finish that one), etc...
</code></pre>
Books that <i>have</i> helped me: Modern software engineering, A philosophy of software design.<p>The latter book talks about mentoring lead discussion groups about application coding, that is something I would probably be very much helped by.<p>Sorry for the long rant, hopefully one of you fine people will have some input.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Also, I just plain like the simpler designs of the late 90s and early 2000s. Finally, I&#x27;m an environmentalist...
