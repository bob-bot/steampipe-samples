34171260,Ask HN: What did you learn this year?,2022-12-29T10:27:12Z,Dowwie,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Elixir: I finally learned Elixir&#x2F;OTP, working with it full-time for data engineering related tasks.  I learned that there was an entire ecosystem of mature data processing related libraries and frameworks.  OTP is very impressive.  It&#x27;s very interesting how pipelines of chained calls utilize pattern-matching in function clauses and how some have rejected use of this pattern.  Mock tests with Tesla http client was the biggest dissapointment thus far.<p>Terraform: Infrastructure as code is everywhere, now.  I never cared to learn a proprietary configuration language for creating infrastructure resources, but am glad that I finally did put some effort into learning the fundamentals.  It feels like we are at the beginning of the automation story with tools such as Terraform.  Maybe AI-assisted tooling will come next, where natural language describing our intention will be all that is necessary, rather than a configuration language.<p>ChatGPT:  I&#x27;m largely using it as a replacement for Google and StackOverflow.  It&#x27;s helped me write json parsers using the &#x27;jq&#x27; command line utility, write regex patterns, write terraform config for AWS resources, and more.  I wish the maximum output were longer.  I didn&#x27;t find code assistance accurate enough to rely on it too much.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
