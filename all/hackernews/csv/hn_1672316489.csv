The goal is to reliably process events published by multiple services - potentially with different data stores.<p>We&#x27;ve already decided to use Sagas to orchestrate the distributed transactions, and now I want to find an event framework that complements Sagas well.<p>For context, we are building an open-source commerce engine striving to be highly extensible. We provide developers with the primitives to create sophisticated commerce experiences and allow them to replace the different domains (PIM, Inventory, etc.) with their own microservices. Hence, maintaining a great developer experience is paramount to us in technical decision-making.<p>It seems the industry standard is to use a Transactional Outbox Pattern (unless you go all in on event sourcing), but I believe this increases the complexity for external developers building microservices as they would need to understand the outbox pattern and expose one themselves to ensure the events system of our engine is fully functional.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a solution that uses a shared cache across microservices to store events in an ongoing distributed transaction - effectively a shared outbox. The transaction orchestrator of the Saga would be responsible for processing the cached events upon successfully committing - or invalidate in case an error is thrown. This solution reduces complexity and boilerplate code for developers. Has anyone heard of a similar pattern? I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything.<p>I am curious to learn how others have solved the problem of events in distributed transactions.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
