I wanted to give it back to some of the authors that still help me in my developer journey, by buying some of their work online and hopefully contributing to their income, but the following happened:<p>1. I went to Amazon, since I have a kindle and didn&#x27;t want to buy physical books. Amazon doesn&#x27;t have a shopping card for kindle books, so I started buying them one by one. My company uses Spendesk for managing funds, so for each of the purchase I created a new virtual card and bought them.
After a few minutes my Amazon account is blocked for suspicious activity, and ALL my kindle library is wiped, and the funds are returned to my company.<p>2. Not wanting to give up, I go to a different online store, Thalia, to buy the books again. After buying them, I download the files, which are in an .acsm format, and can only be opened on the Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) software. Once opened, an .epub file is downloaded, and even though I can&#x27;t transfer the files to my kindle on ADE, I download Calibre to transfer them. Once I try opening them on Calibre, I get an error message saying the files are protected by DRM.
Funnily enough, it&#x27;s possible to remove this DRM protection, but it&#x27;s also not something completely legal, and makes me question why did I decide to legally buy the e-books in the first place.<p>After spending hours trying to buy e-books, having my Amazon account blocked, and downloading files that can&#x27;t be transferred to my Kindle, the only conclusion I come to, is that I&#x27;m never buying e-books again.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
