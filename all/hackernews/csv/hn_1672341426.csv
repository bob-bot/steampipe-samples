34176161,Ask HN: How to get back into tech after two years of absence because of burnout?,2022-12-29T18:41:10Z,tabs_or_spaces,1,false,false,1,[34176197],<null>,<null>,<null>,"So I did not do anything coding or technical for the past two years because of severe burnout. Instead, I chose to become an engineering manager because it was a much different career path and this was really helping me get over the coding burnout that I&#x27;ve accumulated over the years.<p>I feel that I&#x27;m at a stage of my life where I can code again and move back to the IC path. Not that I dislike management, I just like being an IC more. My technical skills are very rusty, like I can probably system design my way through but will struggle initially writing code again.<p>But since that&#x27;s my goal, I need a bit of advice in terms of how to &quot;get back&quot; into the industry after effectively being gone for 2 years as an IC? My current strategy is to do what I did before (choose a language, do leetcode, do sideprojects, join community, read books, etc, etc) but I&#x27;m confused about whether I should be specialising at my age or not? Specialisation for me means to either go into a specific industry (crypto, self driving, etc) or specialising like become a SRE, Data Engineer, etc.<p>Personal context (if stats matters): 37 yrs, 15 yrs tech industry experience. Last language I used before burnout was Go.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

  Do I focus on work closely related to my specialty or take a broad spectrum approach? I have no strong personal preference here.
  Should I prefer depth (fewer, more hours) assignments or breadth (multiple, fewer hours, perhaps get a wider perspective)?
  What are some ways I can look for clients I can provide the greatest value to, other than engaging my network, especially for the specialist work?
  How do I price the work? Do I charge by time&#x2F;sub-project tasks&#x2F;whole projects? How would I determine the rates to charge?
  If I have about two months until I can start working on this business, what are the most impactful preparations I can make?
