And I&#x27;ve noticed, very few papers have been written about truly Distributed Fuzzers, it&#x27;s still quite an emergent field.<p>Less than 6 months ago, Google Open Sourced its internal Distributed Fuzzer called Centipede. It&#x27;s written in C++:
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;centipede"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;centipede</a><p>And it seems like the libfuzzer team is moving on to Centipede: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;llvm.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;LibFuzzer.html#status"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;llvm.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;LibFuzzer.html#status</a><p>However, I think the future of distributed fuzzers will be in Rust of Golang.
