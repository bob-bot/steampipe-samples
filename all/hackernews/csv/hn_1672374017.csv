Basically, I was getting bored with leetcode &#x2F; having to reskill constantly and had a solid offer to immediately enter as a freshy PM without having to transition after 1yr as an IC.<p>I&#x27;m still a bit on the fence, I&#x27;ve enjoyed my current org since I&#x27;ve still been able to code on products I like while building new skills as a technical product manager.<p>I largely see this path as carrying more leverage, I like strategy and I have about 4 years of startup and FAANG tech experience prior to making my transition.<p>I&#x27;m coming up on 1.5yrs of being a PM and I&#x27;m now looking to max TC (looking for $160k + currently remote but I have an apt in NYC).  I took a bit of a hit with my current job since when they hired me I had zero PM experience.<p>Any advice for making myself appealing to FAANG PM roles &#x2F;things to consider?  I&#x27;ve had recruiters reach out and had a few startups looking for founding PM&#x27;s mention I &quot;didn&#x27;t have as much technical experience&quot; as they&#x27;d like.

I only need to know things such as, OK I have an electric signal (voltage for example) and I need  to bend it a bit or smooth it a bit, so I need certain analog components to make it happen, and I can always play with the values to make the curves look like the way I want.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is to throw away the formulas and treat them as Lego blocks or blackboxes. I have an input and I need the output to be of certain value and shape, so I piece together some blocks and make it happen. That&#x27;s it.<p>Does it make sense to you?
