I logged in to find out why a password reset email didn’t go out and found my account had been deactivated.<p>SendGrid didn’t provide any notice that the account was in danger of being deactivated. Support says they don’t provide any warning when accounts are scheduled for closure due to inactivity. The only way to see it is to log in and notice the warning banner at the top of your dashboard. I’m not sure why a person would need to log in when everything seems to be working well.<p>The really confusing part is I’ve been told the account can’t be reopened because it has been deactivated too long. Support says that they would have been able to help if I had contacted them within 30 days. From my perspective today is day 1.<p>SendGrid’s policies seem geared toward getting the account closed down for good. The best explanation I can think of my account got flagged for abuse somehow. No clue why it would be flagged, though… I don’t _think_ I’m doing anything sketchy. Am I overlooking something obvious?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Yesterday, was going to take the kids the the zoo. Check the weather app - all clear for the next several hours but out my window dark clouds rolled in and rain started pelting down. I was looking for the rain forecast bar but it was gone. Then dug into the app more and it was useless. The “old” rain predictor bar was scary accurate. I could check the app before I got up in the morning and see “ rain beginning in 5 min” and sure enough start to hear the pitter pat of rain on the windows. But the new app is awful. Is there anything out there like the old rain prediction? I searched around yesterday for a bit but there are so many rubbish apps in this space I would appreciate someone sharing a good replacement.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
