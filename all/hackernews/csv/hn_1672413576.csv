The previous version was written in Ruby, so users had to either set up a Ruby environment, or use a Docker image instead. This is no longer necessary.<p>This is my first project in Crystal and I love it already! It&#x27;s syntax is lovely - similar to Ruby&#x27;s - and it&#x27;s FAST!<p>I would appreciate any feedback anyone might have - if you are a Kubernetes user as well as a Hetzner customer, please give it a try and let me know what you think, if you encounter any issues etc.<p>During my tests I was able to create a cluster with highly available control plane (3 masters behind a load balancer) and 5 nodes in multiple regions in just *3 minutes*. This is the total time to create the resources (servers, firewall, load balancer, private network), deploy Kubernetes to all the nodes, install some stuff required to provision load balancers and persistent volumes out of the box, and install an upgrade controller to easily upgrade the Kubernetes version (I use k3s as Kubernetes distro). I don&#x27;t think there is a faster way to create a production Kubernetes cluster!<p>Do you have Kubernetes clusters in Hetzner already? If yes, which tool did you use to create them?
