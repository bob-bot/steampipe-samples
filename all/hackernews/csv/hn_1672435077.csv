During my extensive research I&#x27;ve noticed that many universities seem to repackage what&#x27;s essentially the same course - identical or mostly identical lists of modules - under different degree titles. For example, a few of the University of Birmingham&#x27;s Computer Science courses are named as follows:<p>- Computer Science BSc
- Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science BSc
- Computer Science&#x2F;Software Engineering MEng<p>But comparing each degree on the UoB website shows the list of modules is identical apart from one extra module that is removed or added depending on the &quot;specialism&quot;.<p>In the case of these courses by London&#x27;s University of Greenwich:<p>- Computer Science BSc
- Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) 
- Computer Science (Cyber Security) BSc 
- Computer Science (Data Science) BSc<p>...the available modules are completely identical, with one or two becoming compulsory or optional based on the &quot;specialism&quot;.<p>In these cases, where I essentially have the choice to study all of the same modules and there is no difference in content between the courses, how would I choose between them? Would a generic or specialist degree title (Computer Science vs Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)) look more impressive?<p>In other words, does the specialism help, by making the degree look broader, or are future employers&#x2F;freelance clients likely to understand the breadth of a standalone Computer Science degree, and could the specialism make the degree look too narrow?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
