34190719,Ask HN: Is our product validated? Who's right in this situation,2022-12-30T22:15:20Z,jdbohrman,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"So my co-founder and I are debating our next steps in the development of our SaaS. It&#x27;s an OKR development platform for community and DevRel teams that leverages templates and goal based metric reporting.<p>He&#x27;s totally new the industry we&#x27;re in, and has a lot of blind spots in terms of the industry and market. I&#x27;ve been in this space for about five years and have talked extensively with colleagues about their problems implementing the strategy here. So we already have the problem identified, but he thinks that we need more validation before we do any more development.<p>We&#x27;ve also currently conducted 2 live interviews where a team from [REDACTED] said they would love to use our product at $15&#x2F;user but we&#x27;d have to implement SSO and get some compliance set up. My co-founder pretty much thinks that because we can&#x27;t accept them as a customer right now, that it doesn&#x27;t count as validation. He also thinks we need to validate pricing more but this is pretty much standard for OKR tools.<p>The other thing we can&#x27;t agree that&#x27;s validated in the integrations, and this is another thing that comes heavily from a blind spot I feel like for him because the typical needs for a product like this aren&#x27;t going to fluctuate. Any DevRel and community team will need to integrate with a few main platforms:<p>- Github
- Slack
- Discord
- Twitter
- Zapier
- Discourse<p>We have Slack pretty much finished, but I feel like if we just focus on Github and then add Zapier we can cover all the non-real time messaging apps by using a Zap.<p>I&#x27;m totally open to validating the product more, but I don&#x27;t want to stop development if this is only because he lacks the overall context.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
