34191450,Ask HN: Why don't more services offer “pay as you go” pricing?,2022-12-30T23:34:47Z,Shorn,3,false,false,5,"[34191787,34191493,34191457]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"Was browsing a post for a paid search engine just before - the pricing model was USD $ &#x2F;mth.<p>I didn&#x27;t bother to investigate further. There is zero chance I will ever pay for search via subscription.  The amount is not the problem - it&#x27;s the fact of being a recurring subscription.<p>Why don&#x27;t more services offer a &quot;pay as you go” pricing model?<p>As a customer, I like the &quot;pre-paid&quot; or “top-up” model; where you use a credit card to charge your account with an amount, then the product is charged in a “micro-transaction” pricing structure, like 5c per search or something (the amount isn’t important to this post).  But I also don&#x27;t mind the &quot;post-paid&quot; model where I get a bill at the end of the month that varies with usage.<p>What are the downsides of this from the business perspective?<p>Obviously, usage tracking&#x2F;billing is more complex and you need to deal with the &quot;excess usage&quot; problem, but I&#x27;m wondering about non-obvious stuff like:<p><pre><code>  • the business has varying&#x2F;unpredictable liability to the customer base
  • most customers don&#x27;t actually like it - they want the certainty of a monthly bill - especially fearful of &quot;blowout&quot; bills
  • customers don&#x27;t like it because of the perception that the business is incentivized toward inefficiency - e.g. use dark patterns to require the user to do two searches instead of one
</code></pre>
I have experience as a customer of pay as you go pricing models - and I personally like it for many different reasons.<p>If I wanted to use a “pay as you go” pricing model for my own service - what problems should I be prepared to deal with?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
