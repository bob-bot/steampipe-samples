Every time I have an idea about some kind of useful integration between devices and&#x2F;or services it&#x27;s always already done.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I program simply for the joy of programming constantly - I love tinkering with things like ray tracers, or advent of code type problems, or just implementing a data structure&#x2F;algorithm I think might be useful one day.<p>I just yearn to build something that other people can enjoy besides me. I find myself building trinkets that will never see the light of day (or, they will see the light of the day but it will just remain a public repository on my github profile with no one to notice). I&#x27;ve gone the non-profit route but the types of things that non-profits tend to need are usually things like basic brochure sites -- which I&#x27;ve done plenty of -- and I&#x27;d like to do something that taps a little deeper into my skillset.<p>I think I may just be stuck in a rut and I need someone to give me a different perspective to consider.
