Especially when multiple agencies post the same property shot from different angles.<p>I would love to scrape those listings and be able to identify all pictures depicting the same house. The scraping part is easy enough, but how should I proceed with the image grouping&#x2F;recognition. Is there any trained model that is able to say if the pictures belong to the same house?<p>Please note that the agencies will not post the exact address and most of the time they will do interior shots only. This prevents the potential buyer to go knock at the owner’s door.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
