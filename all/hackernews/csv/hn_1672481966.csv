34195031,Show HN: My Yearly Reflection Notion Template,2022-12-31T09:51:22Z,mrccc,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN,
I&#x27;m submitting this again hoping to reach more people today – because it&#x27;s the last day of the year and more people are in a reflective mood.<p>I want to share with you my latest project, the Mental Garden Yearly Reflection. It is a guided introspection in the form of a Notion template that helps you learn from last year, and for deciding how to spend the next one.
For the past three years, I&#x27;ve used the time between Christmas and New Year for reflection, and it had a profound positive impact on my life. As a result, I moved to France and learned French, started playing the trumpet in a big band, and quit my job to pursue my own projects. Without the yearly reflection, I don&#x27;t think I would have made any of these changes. It has been truly valuable for making meaningful changes in my life.<p>There are already a few tools out there that help you do an end-of-year reflection (for example the Year Compass (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yearcompass.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yearcompass.com&#x2F;</a>), but I wasn&#x27;t really satisfied with any of them. They focus on aspects that aren&#x27;t really important to me, and they don&#x27;t include areas that I&#x27;d love to think about. I therefore created this guided introspection (primarily for myself) – so I can think about the areas that are important to me. I hope you find it valuable, too.<p>In the future, I&#x27;d love to turn this into some kind of web-app. You could pick the areas that are important to you, and ask follow-up questions based on the answers. You could then spot year-over-year trends. The most exciting feature for me would be receiving regular emails that remind you of your own answers. For example, say you wrote what you value about your own family. A few months later, you would get an email with this text you wrote. It&#x27;s like an inspirational newsletter – but with your own insights. And then why stop at &quot;yearly&quot; reflection – this would be awesome on a monthly basis, too!<p>I&#x27;m curious about your thoughts and feedback about the template and my vision. It would fill me with absolute joy if someone uses this.<p>Have a great last week of 2022, and see you in 2023!<p>With gratitude, Marc<p>PS: No need to signup, there is a direct link on the download page.

I’ve considered grad school to increase my status but I didn’t get a 4.0 in undergrad (got a 3.9x) and only had second author papers, no first authors. Is there any hope for people like me? I feel like I’ll never be able to retire, own a car, or even upgrade from the tiny studio and austere lifestyle I have.
