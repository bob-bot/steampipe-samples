It was hard and a great experience. When I graduated, I felt like I was ready for anything. Then, I started a venture backed company with two people from Harvard Business School, and I was shocked to realize that everything I learned at Harvard wasn&#x27;t helpful at all.<p>I didn&#x27;t know how to negotiate or express myself. I couldn&#x27;t communicate well. I had to pitch my idea to investors and didn&#x27;t know how. I was not ready to start a company at all. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I knew how to program, but the soft skills was lacking. I feel like my Harvard education didn&#x27;t help me much other than give me the connections that I needed to start the company. That&#x27;s why I support a company like mentordial.com that lets you book a call with top industry experts.<p>Do any of you feel the same way about your college education? Did it prepare you for the real world?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
