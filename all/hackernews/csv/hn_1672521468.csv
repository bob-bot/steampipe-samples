(And not just a payment provider that does subscriptions, as they&#x27;d be expected to support the complete day to day site user flows in addition to taking payments.)<p>In an ideal world all my server would ever need to do to support users and payments is something like grabbing a JWT from a cookie, validating it, and looking at the paid flag.<p>Is there a single provider you&#x27;d suggest for this?  Or is it too many eggs in one (single point of failure) basket and you&#x27;d suggest separate services for the auth flows and the subscription payments - albeit ones which happen to work well together?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a software developer. To the extent that I do it professionally, I do it with professionalism, but that&#x27;s not much of an outlet for creativity. I want to write fun side projects and share them with other people who will enjoy them as well.<p>The problem is that software development is more craft than art.<p>See if this sounds familiar: I&#x27;ll build a new blog with an interesting architecture and a suite of fun features only to post there once &amp; abandon it. I set out to make a game, I have fun building the engine, and then I run out of steam, because I didn&#x27;t actually want to design gameplay or levels or anything. I just wanted to code.<p>I enjoy writing tools, but tools are meant to be used as needed, and every necessary or useful tool that can be built by one person already has been. What&#x27;s the point of writing another static site generator? Nobody else will use it—if they want to publish something on the internet, they&#x27;ve got plenty of excellent options already. And I sure won&#x27;t use it because I don&#x27;t actually have anything to publish. If I were a professional writer or graphic designer, I could satisfy myself writing a short story or painting a painting. You can make art in the medium of writing or drawing. What can we do with the medium of software?<p>When a baker bakes an artisanal loaf of bread, they get to exercise their creativity and make something that people will actually enjoy. I guess you could define art that way—something that&#x27;s a joy to make and a joy to consume. I want that for software. I want to write something in a weekend with rough edges and endearing quirks, instead of a fully-featured, performant, bug-free piece of production software with a maintenance roadmap and a business plan. And I want it to be something that other people can get something out of. Is there a space for this anywhere? Is this a niche that exists? Surely I&#x27;m not the only one who feels this way.

Looking at both the iOS and Android app stores, you&#x27;ll find a lot of the top tuner apps are rather bloated with ads or subscription callouts. I thought I&#x27;d create a dead-simple minimalistic mobile chromatic tuner the way I would like it - open the app and tune my guitar.<p>My work is in web with NodeJS and React, so I chose React Native since it was the easiest to understand coming from React. Flutter was also an option since the company I work for has a team working in that, but I thought it would be a bit too much effort to learn Dart.<p>I learned a bit more about React rendering with this project as well. The main issue I had was trying to have a React state variable be constantly updated with any frequencies detected from the mic input, but that ended up causing substantial slowdown due to so many rerenders, so I opted to use a React ref to maintain any detections, and then only update the React state when there was an actual note. I feel like sometimes the UI has trouble updating occasionally when my iPhone is in battery saving mode, which I guess might be related to throttling the audio sample rate somehow, though I&#x27;m not entirely sure.
