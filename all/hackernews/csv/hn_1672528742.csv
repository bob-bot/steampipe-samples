34201556,Show HN: Vikara – free chatbot to promote healthy eating,2022-12-31T22:48:49Z,pravinh,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"My name is Pravin and I&#x27;m a Flutter developer. I&#x27;ve developed a free chatbot app called Vikara to prevent disordered eating, and would appreciate if you could download and try it out. It is free, asks for no personal info - it does not even have a signup.<p>More details: I had a bout of anxiety driven binge eating last year when Covid hit India pretty hard. I&#x27;m in US and aged parents are in India. I felt helpless being not able to fly there, and constantly worrying about my folks. Fortunately, they came out okay (upto 3 million died in India). I researched what had happened to me, and realized it was &#x27;emotional eating&#x27;. Coincidentally, I was learning Flutter, so built a chatbot using Flutter and DialogFlow.<p>Vikara has 3 conversational flows: prevent overeating, curb binge-eating, maintain a positive body image. Each conversation flow is based on evidence-based research papers that I found in the public domain. At this point, I&#x27;m looking for feedback from users, so I would appreciate if you could please download and try it, and let me know what you think. Constructive criticism is welcome as well. You can send feedback directly to me at: pravin@vikara.app<p>Thanks and best regards,
