34204382,Ask HN: Question about “preferred shares” vs. “super voting shares”,2023-01-01T07:28:36Z,valachio,2,false,false,2,[34204427],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;m raising capital for a startup for the first time.<p>At my startup we currently have 2 classes of shares. Class A is a &quot;super voting&quot; share with 10 votes and Class B is a common share with 1 vote. Pretty standard nowadays.<p>I understand VCs want to buy &quot;preferred&quot; stock with liquidation preferences. How will that work into our dual-class stock system? Will we need to create a Class C share for VCs for the preferred stock? Or is it a special type of stock which does not require a new class of shares to be implemented?<p>Also, some articles I read say that preferred shares have no voting rights, is that right? Does that mean VCs purchase shares with liquidation preference but with 0 voting power?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
