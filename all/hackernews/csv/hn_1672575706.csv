Is it violating a user&#x27;s privacy if somebody can check to see if they are using a site or service or not just be entering their email address into a registration form?<p>If it is a privacy issue, do you think it matters for non-sensitive sites?  For example, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that an adult website or a job search site really needs to protect the identity of their registered users.  But, what if it&#x27;s something like Goodreads or Amazon, where knowing somebody is a member isn&#x27;t really a sensitive thing?<p>Does the convenience of a user knowing if they&#x27;ve already registered on the site before figuring out a password and doing a captcha ever outweigh the potential privacy concerns?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
