34209099,Show HN: My (Attempt) at a Public Health Infrastructure,2023-01-01T18:27:14Z,arionhardison,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"At the beginning of the pandemic there was lots of talk about public health infrastructure etc... and I read this article [1].  This is my idea&#x2F;vision of how a public health infrastrcture could look&#x2F;work.  I decided to focus on the intersection of health and education first because (see below)<p>1: Its an intresting problem that impacts peoples lives in a big way<p>2: I have worked for lots of edtech companies<p>3: I am really into health and wellness<p>4: I was raised by my dad because my mother was in and out of facilities due to mental illess<p>5: Racial Profiling [2] is not my biggest issue, menthal helth is<p>First thing I needed to do was understand the problem, current state of things and where I could improve &#x2F; what metrics etc..
The main problems I see are that...
1: Mental Health is to &quot;reactionary&quot;.  Something happens, peole focus on it for a week or so then move on.
2: Mental Health servcies dont scale very well under the curent model
3: Not everyone has the same idea of what it means to be mentally healthy or how to get there
4: Gen-Z should IMO be more involoved in the process of what&#x2F;how
5: Its too disconnected, IMO if a program works in one place other places should be able to adopt that programs best practices<p>The concept I settled on was to create a tool that lets school districts (and later state public health depts.) create a baseline mental health and wellness protocol expressed as an automated digital workflow.  Basicly population health management based on custom workflows. I knew the system would need to be multi tenant, each &quot;tenant&quot; e.g.: LAUSD, SFUSD etc... has its own database. So I need a &quot;Publishing&quot; type of mechanism for program management so tenants can share programs etc... I am now at the point where I have been able to do the following<p>1: Create a program [3]<p>2: Publish it<p>3: Get program request on tenant admin<p>4: Approve from dashboard<p>5: Visit tenant page and follow program to completion (paid and free)<p>6: Import population<p>7: Manage population as they complete program<p>My next step is to complete the FHIR integration and integrate OpenAI so each program manager (aka: creator) has an ai assistant to help them manage&#x2F;create programs and add more Modules.<p>Note: Phase 1 was schools and Phase 2 is state health depts.  My dad worked for metro (nashville) social services for 30+ years, just retired; so i talked to him about processes etc... and I am going to codify their programs too as well as provide multi-district population view for workers but its probably going to be end of Jan maybe Feb before I can roll out that beta.<p>Note: Currently all tenants e.g.: lausd.health, aacps.health, cps.health etc...redirect to the wellness page of the ditricts existing website.  I am sending each district their login e.g: admin.sfusd.health where they can approve program request and all that kind of stuff if they want.  In the meantime I am creating programs based on their current wellness policies.<p>Note: My fist choice is to give the tool to the ditrict but if they dont want it I have been able to identify at least one other group in each area that is intrested.<p>Note: If you login and want to use the &quot;Protocol Builder&quot; you can upload any image where it says ID and Ill approve it.<p>Note: I am currently working on documentation and help text etc...<p>[1] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a16z.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;18&#x2F;its-time-to-build&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a16z.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;18&#x2F;its-time-to-build&#x2F;</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextcity.org&#x2F;urbanist-news&#x2F;crowdsource-police-reviews-transparency"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nextcity.org&#x2F;urbanist-news&#x2F;crowdsource-police-review...</a><p>[3] - An example program would be something like:<p>A: send a check-in assessment 2x per month<p>B: based on result of assessment schedule follow up with care team member<p>C: send nudges 3x per week w&#x2F; optional feedback<p>D: ...<p>Ive been up for a few days and need to get some rest but will answer any questions anyone has.
