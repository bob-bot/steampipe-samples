However, the official website to list games is horrible. It takes forever to load, it&#x27;s hard to navigate, and weirdly difficult to just look up if a game you care about is available on Game Pass.<p>Enter <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isitongamepass.gg"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;isitongamepass.gg</a> - a super fast site where you can look up the current Game Pass roster. My goals going into it were speed and easily accessible information. Each card has a game title, a poster image, and the set of platforms it&#x27;s available on. If you click on a card, it opens up a details view that has links to the store page for the game as well as a description and availability details.<p>This is something I put together in my free time and is the first website I&#x27;ve built (although I&#x27;m a professional software engineer) so I have no doubt there are some bugs. If you run into something, please comment here or send me a DM. Same goes if you have ideas for improvements!<p>A couple other random things:<p><i>Why are some games listed twice?</i><p>There&#x27;s a weird thing where some games have different store IDs on console vs PC. There&#x27;s no good way I&#x27;ve found so far to combine these listings so they show up twice, once for the console version and once for the PC version.<p><i>Why .gg?</i><p>It turns out isitongamepass.com is an already owned domain with nothing on it. I briefly had the thought of making it isitongamepa.ss, but you can&#x27;t really do this because of Nazis.<p><i>Things I&#x27;m thinking about for the future of this site</i>
