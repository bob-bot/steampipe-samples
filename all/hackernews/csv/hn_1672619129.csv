And the online events are usually prerecorded videos and marketing pitches. Even extremely popular areas (like web dev) have basically zero IRL presence within a 50-mile radius.<p>I keep waiting for the community to rebound, but I&#x27;m not sure it ever will.

execution, and distributed workloads.<p>Spreadsheet execution order is determined by data dependency.
If cell A depends on cell B then cell B must compute first.<p>The first optimization would be partial cell computation until the
dependent data is available.<p>Which thought leads me to linear types and distributed workloads.
One could block a computation waiting for a result. Linear types
seem like an excellent model for such communication. It is
especially interesting if the communicated values are not just a
simple cell value but more complex types.<p>Further down the rabbit hole is implementing the spreadsheet in lisp.
Each cell has its associated lisp function. The interesting aspect here
is that you transform a &quot;time-based&quot; model of computation to a
&quot;dependency-based&quot; model. Such a model is easily distributed.<p>One could write a &quot;spreadsheet macro&quot; in lisp with a list of functions
to embed in particular cells.<p>For a recent discussion see:<p>Homoiconic spreadsheets&#x2F; What, How &amp; Why (by Eli Parra)
