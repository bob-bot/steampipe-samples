34214799,Show HN: Banger–A Firefox extension to extend DDG's bangs,2023-01-02T05:48:17Z,WhistlingZephyr,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hello HN! I made this Firefox extension to extend upon DuckDuckGo&#x27;s idea of bangs (check <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;bangs"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duckduckgo.com&#x2F;bangs</a> if you aren&#x27;t familiar with them) and also allow the use of any search engine with them.<p>I found DuckDuckGo&#x27;s bangs fascinating, but was disappointed by how little search engines inherit that feature. And on top of it, DuckDuckGo has the &quot;!&quot; bang that jumps to the first search result but other search engines offering bangs like Brave Search, searx, You.com don&#x27;t seem to have that. I also thought that the &quot;!&quot; bang could be extended with the ability to jump to the first search result of a specific site, so I added the &quot;!!&quot; bangs in my extension that allow you to do just that (e.g. typing &quot;!!mdn flatMap&quot; will bring up the MDN page for flatMap). I also added a bunch of extra features like the ability to add custom bangs, ability to search in a search engine with the &quot;site:&quot; parameter using &quot;!@r&quot; (r for Reddit), or &quot;!ddg@r&quot; (specify any other bang as the search engine to use), and the ability to chain multiple bangs together with &quot;;&quot; to open them up in different tabs; it also allows you to use multiple &quot;site:&quot; parameters combined with the OR (&quot;|&quot;) operator with &quot;,&quot; (e.g. &quot;!@r,yt&quot;). Feel free to mix and match! Also, for those who use it, it supports sync. There&#x27;s also an option to import&#x2F;export any settings including custom bangs. I&#x27;ve also added custom handling to fix a few bangs which are usually broken such as &quot;!archived&quot; and &quot;!imgops&quot; (They require unescaped URL as part of the path. However, DDG and other search engines always escape the URL. Banger only escapes the URL if it&#x27;s part of an URL parameter).<p>I&#x27;ve been working on it for around 2 months now, and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the result so far. Let me know if you have any comments&#x2F;feature suggestions&#x2F;bug reports&#x2F;anything else!",story,https://github.com/WhistlingZephyr/banger,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Twitter lost 50% of its workers and Elon Musk just recently tweeted: &quot;Significant backend server architecture changes rolled out. Twitter should feel faster.&quot;, and they&#x27;ve also released new features. HN commenters said that due to the firings, Twitter wouldn&#x27;t be able to change things without breaking everything in the way anymore.
