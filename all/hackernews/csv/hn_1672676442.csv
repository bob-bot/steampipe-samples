In the last 6 months I have already done quite a lot of extra stuff (but without working extra hours, of course) and this time I find it harder to come up with new shiny stuff to show.<p>My usual day-to-day duties of senior engineer are: work on my Jira issues, improve the state of our code bases, talk with stakeholders to gather&#x2F;clarify requirements, talk with other engineers&#x2F;PMs to push features that span more than one team&#x27;s effort, mentor more junior colleagues, do tech interviews, keep our documentation up-to-date, and basically all be the insible glue that makes everything work... Now, this doesn&#x27;t give you automatically a raise (it&#x27;s a shame because it&#x27;s hard work, and it&#x27;s work none of my other colleagues does) since I have already used all of that to get a raise last year.<p>So, I&#x27;ve been planning my &quot;accomplishments&quot; for the next 6 months. I don&#x27;t really mind doing silly&#x2F;useless&#x2F;useful&#x2F;hard work; my goal is just to get a raise. This is what I came up with:<p>- introduce the team to TypeScript by &quot;rewriting&quot; one of our simplest and smallest services on it. 100% of the services we own are written in JS, so TS would be a win for everyone (devs: something new to show in their CVs, em: less bugs, system: easier to work with in the long term)<p>- introduce the team to Go. In our company some teams are already using Go for microservices. The gain here for the team would be to get to know another programming language and environment (so that would be good for their CVs), and for the managers the selling point would be: performance and attract more talent (since Go is kinda sexier than JS&#x2F;TS somehow)<p>I&#x27;m a bit stuck for now in getting more ideas. I imagine that as time goes, I&#x27;ll get more opportunities to work on something more visible (e.g., team X needs help with feature Y that has some relationship with out services... I would raise my hand to help them with that), but do you know some generic stuff that I could use to impress my eng. manager and get my raise?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

She always said that if you copy code from one place and paste it into another, you are obviously creating redundant code. She calls it &quot;inheriting from the Clipboard,&quot; which I think it pretty clever and memorable.<p>When you copy code, ask yourself why you are doing it—and if the same operation is needed in two places, doesn’t this indicate that you need a service in your system?<p>My boss and mentor Alan Shalloway puts it this way: There are three numbers in software: 0, 1, and infinity. 0 represents the things we do not do in a system (we do those for free). 1 represents the things we do once and only once. But at the moment we do something twice, we should treat it as infinitely many and create cohesive services that allow it to be reused.&quot;<p>It actually came from a 2009 book called &quot;Emergent Design: The Evolutionary Nature of Professional Software Development&quot;. Somewhat goes against the grain of the more common wisdom of taking the bullet once or twice.
