It cannot take into account the brand&#x27;s personality, target audience, and design trends, or apply design principles such as balance and hierarchy.<p>In fact, AI can even help to free up time for designers to focus on more complex, high-level projects. So, embrace the technology and let it enhance your work, rather than replacing it.
