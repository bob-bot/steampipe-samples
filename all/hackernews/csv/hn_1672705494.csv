I&#x27;ve been inspired to start hacking on ML stuffs and I&#x27;m having tons of fun just using it for making images.  My m1 is ooookay at it - but it&#x27;s time to upgrade.<p>I <i>could</i> drop a bunch on a 3090 and call it a day, but I really don&#x27;t need to be gaming and anyhow looking at passmark(1) it seems like I could get more throughput &#x2F; $ with an array of cheaper cards and a box that&#x27;ll take more cards...<p>..Which leads to some questions, because I&#x27;m kind of ignorant.<p>- What metric should I be looking at for running ML pipelines?  Performance(1)?  GPU Compute(2)? Should I just go for the most memory &#x2F; dollar?<p>- Are there other considerations (tensor cores etc) that go into this? It looks like the GTX series doesn&#x27;t have em, so I&#x27;m assuming those are a no-go.<p>- Is there a reason to prefer Radeon or Geforce over the other?<p>- Do all the cards have to be the same, or can I just get whatever is handy at the moment and put em all in together?<p>- How much do I care about the CPU?  This box will be doing nothing but running ML pipes.<p>- Finally, would I be better off saving up for an A30 or some such (in terms of power &#x2F; price)?<p>Reading up on (3), I gather that I&#x27;ll need the cards to be single-slot with SLI or Crossfire, and a big beefy power supply, along with an ATX board with four slots.<p>The plan is to have this thing running as a server in a closet, so I can send it jobs from the laptop.

Then in an effort to secure things you add on frontend&#x2F;backend networks to isolate containers from each other.<p><pre><code>   services:
     proxy:
       build: .&#x2F;proxy
       networks:
         - frontend   
     app:
       build: .&#x2F;app
       networks:
         - frontend
         - backend   
     db:
       image: mysql
       networks:
         - backend
      </code></pre>
You add config to share credentials between services.<p><pre><code>   services:
     app:
       build: .&#x2F;app
       environment:
         DB_PASSWORD_FILE: &#x2F;run&#x2F;secrets&#x2F;db_root_password
       secrets:
         - db_root_password
     db:
       image: mysql
       environment:
         MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE: &#x2F;run&#x2F;secrets&#x2F;db_root_password
       secrets:
         - db_root_password
         
   secrets:
     db_root_password:
       file: .&#x2F;secrets&#x2F;db_root_password.txt
    
    </code></pre>
Is there a way to abstract away these extra configuration steps and keep it simple yet secure by default?<p>If you would express db as a dependency&#x2F;resource of app, could you infer that you could put it in a seperate network and have the credentials automatically link?
&#x27;As a developer&#x27; I&#x27;m not really interested in the network specifics or which credentials, I just want them to talk securely and minimize any attack vectors and keep any configuration to a minimum.
With tens of apps, their databases and transversal connections, how to do you keep the configuration to a minimum?<p>Googling around I found;<p>humanitec:
https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.humanitec.com&#x2F;integrations&#x2F;resource-types&#x2F;mariadb
They express something as &#x27;resources&#x27;, a dependency type that can be provisioned automatically with inputs and outputs that then can be injected in the application env vars:
mysql:&#x2F;&#x2F;${externals.my-db.username}:${externals.my-db.password}@${externals.my-db.host}:${externals.my-db.port}&#x2F;${externals.my-db.name}<p>you&#x27;re limited to a limited set of drivers ofcourse and how would you express an app1 to app2 dependency?<p>juju:
https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juju.is&#x2F;<p>Each app is packaged in a charm which seems to be a yaml declaring inputs, dependencies and other meta data and optional python code that can respond to certain lifecycle hooks<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discourse.charmhub.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;implementing-relations&#x2F;1051<p><pre><code>   name: my-node-app
   ...
   requires:
     database:
       interface: mongodb
   provides:
     website:
       interface: http
    </code></pre>
Things can seemingly be autowired based on what interface they provide and require?
So just make a list of apps until everything resolves?<p>Does anyone have experience with these tools or others like it?<p>How do you stop others and yourself from drowning in credentials, certificates, env vars, jvm params and k8s yaml(times every environment)
How do you do (not the configuration management) but manage an inventory of what configuration is needed to run your environment (or a subset for ci)?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
