34228032,Show HN: Twenty questions using GPT-3 API,2023-01-03T05:26:36Z,akjeet,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi, I build the twenty questions game using GPT-3. It was a fun trying to use GPT-3 to provide specific answers.<p>To play - I found it works best if you ask full question. It is not 100% fool proof. It gets confused with few questions - like it may say No to both &quot;is player retired&quot; or &quot;is player active&quot;
If question is single word but it is somehow associated with the word to be guessed, it would say Yes. Once the game is over (or if you give up) it would show the final answer and few lines of information.<p>I hope you like it. Any suggestions &#x2F; issues welcome. Thanks!",story,https://q20.aksoft.tech/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
