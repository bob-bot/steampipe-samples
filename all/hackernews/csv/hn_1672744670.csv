That would speed up the evolution of eukaryotic cells on Earth and would make the life we know of possible (within our time frame).<p>Anyone has any knowledge on the topic? Can we speculate which one would evolve on Earth and which on Mars? My impression is bacteria is more resistant to harsher conditions so it would be Archea on Earth and bacteria on Mars but maybe someone with a deeper knowledge can comment?<p>I was inspired by the recent debate about why we should not send humans to Mars soon. Now this idea supports it so that we will have more time to study the origins of life.<p>All the best for new year :)",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
