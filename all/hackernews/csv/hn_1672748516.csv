Through this platform, we aim to create the first research dataset of music-caption pairs, which will give us insights into how people describe music and support the development of audio-text ML models.<p>There is an increasing need for music datasets that go beyond categorical labels and we hope that our data collection efforts will promote more research on the relationship between natural language and music audio, and its many potential applications. If you&#x27;re interested in this field or are curious or willing to contribute, you can head to Song Describer to read more about it and start annotating right away!<p>For more information about the platform&#x27;s design, see the late-breaking demo presented at the ISMIR 2022 conference: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ismir2022program.ismir.net&#x2F;lbd_405.html",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Since the chat GPT came out, I feel like I have a wingman who does things for me super quickly. I&#x27;ve used it a bit and am aware of how to use it. From a security perspective, it does some cool things, like figuring out security issues in code and sometimes providing proof-of-concept code for exploiting them. Sometimes the vulnerabilities are very theoretical and don&#x27;t make sense, but I think that&#x27;s alright. Other automated tools that do code reviews also bring in false positives.<p>I personally think chat GPT has a lot of potential and will grow and learn more over time.
