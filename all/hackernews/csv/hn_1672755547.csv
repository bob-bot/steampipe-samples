I did not receive any security e-mails to my original account nor my recovery e-mail addresses related to any login attempts. To make sure it&#x27;s not my mailserver which is compromised, I logged in into all known Google accounts I have (on a different device) and checked the security log which (as of my knowledge) can&#x27;t be changed&#x2F;wiped. All seemed fine and I received security related e-mails as expected when I logged in myself. I ignored the incident even though I am pretty sure that auth codes will only be sent after a valid password has been entered.<p>Today I received an e-mail stating that my Apple accounts surname has been changed: Two characters have been added to my original surname. What I thought was a fake e-mail turns out to be valid: my surname was actually changed as I verified on my device in the iOS settings. Again, no login attempt was being reported to me and I was not asked for a 2FA code on my phone (the only Apple device I own). I could change my surname back without problems.<p>All accounts have 2FA via TOTP. All accounts have their own unique-randomly generated passwords. I specifically don&#x27;t have SMS 2FA enabled because I know that SIM-swapping is a thing. I checked Have I Been Pwned without any results. I store all my passwords in a self-hosted Vaultwarden which is in itself 2FA protected. I use the browser extensions in Firefox and Edge as well as the Windows and iOS Bitwarden App from the respective official stores. My mails are hosted on a smaller-but-known mail provider from Switzerland (not Protonmail). The amount of e-mails I received for my domain matches the amount of e-mails that are being reported in the admin interface of the e-mail provider for that domain on that day, so I think it&#x27;s unlikely that someone quickly deleted e-mails. The MX-DNS records for my domain are fine and are also protected behind 2FA.<p>I know the usual advice is to rotate my passwords which I will do, but I do not know which of my devices I can trust currently. The question begging me more though is: why would someone append two characters to my surname and why is nothing &quot;happening&quot; with my data?
