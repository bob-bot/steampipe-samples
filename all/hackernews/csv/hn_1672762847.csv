When you run a website, it can sometimes take months for Google to index new URLs. If you are a business, or you are an impatient blogger, this can be problematic.<p>As a service, this project is just a shortcut way for non technical folk to use the Google Indexing API. That way, they can index new URLs instantly.<p>In other words - Google offers an API. The API is very useful, but it requires some technical-know how to set up and use.

Most of the time it usually goes very well, unless I&#x27;ve heavely understimated the task which happens 1&#x2F;10 times. Most of the things I need to do are important but not urgent, so they require to be proactive<p>* I get bored or distracted easily, I don&#x27;t belive in ADHD, but according to the definition I definetly have it. So thats why I sometimes prefer tinker with a RPi on a project that has my interest instead of the ticket I know I can finish by just focusing 15min.<p>* I gravitate to being a night owl, but I like to be an easly bird. In a period of my life I was getting up at 5:45 and studying and excersicing. Getting up early made it that I can do tasks without distraction before anybody got up. Issue is my tendency to leave things till the last minute fucks up with sleep schedule making me a night owl for a couple of days and then fucking me up if I wanna go back to wake up early.<p>* As typical in procrastinators, I tend to ignore big tasks because they seem difficult or tedious, but when you start doing them most of the time I get into the flow in about 15mins into the task making me wonder why did I took so long to start the task.<p>* Most crucially, I fundamentally thing theres always &quot;more time&quot;, which objectively and rationally I know this is not the case, but the way I manage myself during the day is: &quot;Nah&#x27; I can do this later&quot;. When in reality its up to my most convinience to do that task right then and there.<p>* Also, you may relate to this, I have 2000 videos on my youtube watch later playlist and lost count on my &quot;To read&quot; bookmark on Chrome.<p>I wanna try new things this year, write goals quaterly and maybe look for a mantra, some word of escenario I can pop into my head to make me do what I need to do in that moment.<p>Thanks in advanced.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It&#x27;s bearable if changes are incremental and not too many cpp files are affected. If change is applied to a fundamental header file, this often results in a very long compilation process just to find that deep down there is another problematic cpp file. This means iterations (code change and rebuild) get longer and longer. I know it&#x27;s possible to compile a specific file&#x2F;project manually, but it would be really cool to automate this and get to the problematic file sooner and not waste time recompiling files without issues…<p>So the idea is to accumulate compilation statistics and estimate the conditional probability of successful compilation of project files given information about already compiled files. So the build process can prioritize compilation and avoid compiling &quot;similar&quot; files.<p>Our company MatLogica is looking for an open-source C++ developer to implement this idea and we can sponsor development for ninja-build.
We think this can save a lot of man&#x2F;hours in the world, make developers more productive and save on CPU energy bills.<p>Or perhaps a solution to this problem already exists?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Stripe has resolved the issue and everything has been released. I told the contacts at Stripe that I would do a write up about what happened from my point of view to help them understand what happened to me. I figured it would be good to do that write up publicly to help both Stripe and potential Stripe customers understand what happened and how it was resolved.<p>Summary: Stripe put my accounts in review for a spike in sales on Cyber Monday. Throughout the month we received very little communication from Stripe and had many support chats and calls. Keep in mind that the whole time Stripe was still accepting payments on our behalf on all of these accounts. Each of the chats&#x2F;calls asked us to upload the same invoices each time for review and gave us vague information that our accounts were being reviewed. Finally out of frustration I posted on HN about my issue. Thanks to @dang for getting a Stripe employee to respond and he was finally able to resolve the issue for me.<p>Overall this review process was pretty bad. Very little communication and nothing I could really do directly to move things along or get any real information. It took a random Stripe employee to get an email from @dang and post on HN in order to get this issue resolved. I’m lucky because I know about HN and know that Stripe employees frequent the site, but I don’t think HN wants to become the Stripe support forum.<p>Stripe you can do better. We all know that in order to scale you need to automate pieces of your infrastructure and communication. But, there is a balance between automation and manual review. When someone like me gets caught up in an automated system there needs to be better ways of letting support help that person.<p>See my comments below for actual details and dates.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34232669,Ask HN: How do I communicate to my employer that I am pregnant?,2023-01-03T15:32:18Z,tianlong,2,false,false,2,[34232876],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I work for a European IT company and I am 4 months pregnant. I think it is the good moment to communicate to my employer the situation: the risky first three months have passed and there is enough time to prepare before my maternity leave of 4 months. Also, I work remotely and I meet my team once per month. During the last visit, I didn&#x27;t have any belly and no one noticed anything, but now it is pretty visible and I would like to tell them before they see me next time. Now, I don&#x27;t know what is the best way to handle the communication: I have a regional manager who is my line manager, but I don&#x27;t work with him. Instead, I work with a team who has a product owner and a manager who doesn&#x27;t not belong to my region or to my department, but who is the one approving my financial engagement. 
Should I first contact my line manager, the manager who is paying me, the team I am working with or the HR? Has anyone been in a similar situation?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
