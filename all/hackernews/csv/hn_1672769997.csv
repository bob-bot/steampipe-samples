Looking for some advice one launching a very niche product soon.<p>I already know it will save my clients time. Currently they manually import information from a spreadsheet into accounting software. This can take some of my clients a day to do as it is extremely tedious.<p>The best part is, once all the bugs and flow is worked out it can all be completely automated. Client would only need to set it up properly and then verify in their accounting software.<p>My current list of items to complete before launch:
1. Create videos on how to use it.
2. Documentation with links to the videos for each key step.
3. Maybe ask questions after first use to find out pricing before making it public.
... looking for more here.<p>What are some key steps I should take before launching to all my customers and market to outside my customer base.<p>I&#x27;m also struggling on how to price this value added service.
It can make a days worth of work into minutes.<p>Not sure if I should price it based on actions, customers, or just general tiered pricing.<p>The service will launch with no pay window. You will use it once and after that it will ask you to pay before using it again.<p>Should I create a questionnaire for the beta users to find out a good base price?<p>Thank you",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
