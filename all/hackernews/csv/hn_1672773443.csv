* APRIL 2022: Hackers took over admin control of our business manager and started running fraudulent ads. Ad account was disabled. Once support refunded our fraudulent ad spend, they closed our case without removing the hackers and giving admin control back to us.
* NOVEMBER 2022: Disturbing and offensive videos began posting on our @bloomineasy Facebook page and a new claim was created since the old claim was closed without resolution.
* JANUARY 2023: Meta Support still won’t take down the page from public access and repeatedly tell us to be patient while they investigate the claim.<p>Action needed ASAP

I thought it would be a fitting time to share a project I&#x27;ve been working on called Y2K. It&#x27;s a code golfing language that can interpret file timestamps as code and ignore all file content, effectively allowing a set of 0-byte files to collectively form a solution to a problem. The repo has some small examples, including a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; program, printing the Fibonacci Sequence up to N terms, and Fizz Buzz. Most of the current examples only create 1-3 files when exported.<p>To make it easier to write programs, the interpreter allows writing all logic &quot;raw&quot; as file content, rather than requiring users to manually modify file timestamps one by one. These files can then be exported to a set of 0-byte files with their timestamps modified to achieve the same functionality.<p>It&#x27;s still in a fairly early stage and has quite a few limitations, but I&#x27;m curious what people think at this point.
