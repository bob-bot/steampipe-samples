I always preceived a hatred towards microservices in many of the comments to any post related to the topic. I am not a software engineer but a DevOps and I have to admit that I find the idea of microservices, at least conceptually, fascinating and powerful: a piece of software that performs one task within a domain and comunicates with other parts of the domain by using the network. Like a well defined cog that is part of a bigger machine.
The concept fits in my head really well. It follows, IMHO the &quot;Unix pilosophy&quot; which I am fan of (Do one thing and do it well™). So, I would like to get the take of the experts in the room:<p>- Are microservices inherently bad or your criticism might come from a terrible implementation you&#x27;ve had to suffer?<p>- In an ideal scenario where said implementation and architecture is well designed and robust, would you enjoy working with them?<p>- Might be the case that your &quot;hate&quot; comes from the fact that this approach presents a lot of unknowns where a monolith provides a well known solution that you are familiar with?<p>- Do you think, honestly, that it is just a trend that comes from the big companies and book sellers and eventually will dissapear and there is no a real need for it for the vast majority of cases?<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve had to manage microservices architecture as part of my job and also developed some side projects, so, I am not speaking from just purely a theoretical POV.<p>Thank you in advance for your answers.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
