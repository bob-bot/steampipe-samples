Even when I’m connected to wifi, and expecting a pop up from the os, or a browser redirect if I go to http page, to the Wi-Fi login pages, nothing loads. Does iOS have to try making a connection on the wwan before trying wan, and the wwan is sending my packets into a ‘no packet gateway bearer for you’ black hole, in a way that doesn’t time out, so iOS never tries wan to get the redirect?
