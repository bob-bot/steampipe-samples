Typically an ERFA-group is a mix between a facilitated session (eg presentation of a daily topic) and an open discussion or workshop between the participants.<p>I&#x27;ve both hosted and participated in groups like this before, but I feel like the crowd here on HN could certainly help me improve on the concept. I&#x27;m sure quite a few people in here participate in professional networks like this one - either open source projects or just professionally related arenas in general.<p>The question is really:<p>- What is it that keeps you coming back to a group like this?<p>- What kills your motivation to join a group like this (eg &quot;subtle selling from the organizer&quot;)?<p>- What traits do a good professional community have in your eyes?<p>- Would you ever be willing to pay to participate in a group like this?<p>- What are the most important take-aways for you, when you spend time in networks like these (networking, knowledge, inspiration, peer-reviews etc.)?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
