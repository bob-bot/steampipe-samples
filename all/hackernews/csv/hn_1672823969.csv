34243401,Ask HN: Best practices for distributing a commercial JavaScript library,2023-01-04T08:38:04Z,alex_suzuki,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN crowd,<p>I&#x27;m planning to launch a commercial software product aimed at businesses in the next couple of months. It&#x27;s a JavaScript module with heavy client-side processing intended to be integrated into mobile web apps.<p>Customers sign up for a subscription and get a license key, which they use to &quot;activate&quot; the library - I&#x27;m aware of the implications of such a scheme wrt. reverse engineering&#x2F;abuse, but I will worry about that when I have actual paying customers. I don&#x27;t handle any payment data, I plan to outsource this by using Paddle (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paddle.com&#x2F;) as a Merchant of Record.<p>So far so good... what I&#x27;m a bit vague on are the legal bits. I&#x27;m bootstrapped and don&#x27;t want to hire a lawyer as long as I&#x27;m not generating revenue. What is the bare minimum of legal documents that I need to provide? Terms &amp; Conditions, License Agreements, Privacy Policy, ... I&#x27;ve heard about all of these but usually click through, like the rest of you. ;-) I saw stuff like Termly.io but somehow I think it&#x27;s not a good fit (more focused on &quot;Cloud SaaS&quot;). Are there any resources or good templates around? Just copy and modify a competitors documents maybe?<p>Also I&#x27;m not yet sure how to distribute the library. Putting myself in the shoes of a customer-side developer, I just want to type `npm install @awesome&#x2F;product`, which would mean publishing a minified version on NPM. I use Gitlab for CI and they also have private repositories, which I already use, but which would in turn require me to create access tokens for customers, and also the customers needs to modify `.npmrc`. On the other hand I&#x27;d have more control.<p>Thanks in advance for any pointers and comments.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
