Albeit, I haven&#x27;t been in a coding role in almost a decade.<p>My entry point into tech was web development (teens&#x2F;college) but found myself intrigued by design and UX challenges, so I went from a front-end developer in college into product&#x2F;UX design and did that for some years.<p>What I know now that I didn&#x27;t know then:
- Every role &#x2F; skill set has its challenges, especially when you get into the more advanced tiers. In my early 20s I thought that &quot;coding wasn&#x27;t for me&quot; because I was hitting seemingly insurmountable walls. Now I know those are simply the challenges that help you level up.
- You can be good at anything and get whatever job you want if you set your mind to it. Surely some of us are more right-brained or left-brained, but I feel like there is an argument to why coding is creative and how PM&#x2F;design is technical.<p>I guess I just miss coding. I miss not dealing with people problems. I miss the incremental feeling of achievement with shipping code. I don&#x27;t like that my work performance is dependent on politics, ambiguity, and people stuff instead of things working or not working.<p>Product management doesn&#x27;t have that same joy for me and I&#x27;m not sure if this is right for me.<p>How do I get back into a coding job?
