In general VMware Horizon View is nice because it allows for a flexible remote&#x2F;work environment and can hop on your machine anywhere in the office as needed, but the major drawback is that the server-based PC&#x27;s just don&#x27;t have the raw horsepower needed compared to a shiny new PC all spec&#x27;d out.  
Looking for other alternatives that will run as fast as a local dev box, but still give the flexibility of something like VMWare Horizon View.

At least some aspect of it (it seems to be about more SDLC, rather than ergonomy of keyboard shortcuts).<p>They seem to want to go broad with the tooling. At least this is the impression I got when reading their WWW. Nothing wrong with it. I suppose eventually they would have 5 to 10 more things than just the Merge Queue and the Flaky Bot.<p>I&#x27;d be curious what other ideas people might have for tools like this.<p>Let me start with a few from myself. Curious what others say:<p>1. A better Dependabot, which at least in Java (Maven&#x2F;Gradle) ecosystem works only for basic projects. It has so many limitations.<p>2. Onboarding helper. I.e. something which sets up everything for a new developer, and maintains that consistency of the setup going forward. So that the infra&#x2F;DevOps teams (who I guess would be the key users at your customers) can use it to provide consistent but flexible setup for everyone. And be able to evolve that. I mean things like IDE, build script setup with all the dependencies, key tools installed  like terraform, GH client, a linter, etc. All of them in the same version for everyone.<p>3. Command-line friendly and user friendly credentials interface. Think of a mix of 1Password and hashicorp vault. But it should work well in all three contexts: nice GUI, CLI and automation (not only on my laptop, but as part of some CI pipeline or other toolling). It doesn&#x27;t have to be the storage, delegate to 1P&#x2F;HCV.<p>4. A collaboration tool for dealing with different kind of error messages, warnings and problems. Think of something like a mix of StackOverflow and Sentry. Group by type of the error, but focus on what developers experience in their dev environment (tests, build scripts, etc.). Deduplicate, store and offer solutions as a knowledge base<p>5. Time measurement tool, but not the one for my employer to check if I waste time on Facebook. But measure the length of my cycles - i.e. count of local runs before I commit, or count of CI-failure-then-fix iterations. And aggregate that, so that again my DevOps team can see some stats and know how to increase velocity by knowing what are the bottlenecks (but don&#x27;t trust subjective feelings on that, gather data).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34251186,Tell HN: YouTube is making a TikTok junky out of me,2023-01-04T20:40:45Z,throwaway98781,2,false,false,3,"[34251356,34251486,34251404]",<null>,<null>,<null>,"TL;DR: Youtube is using a dark pattern to lure its users into its Youtube Shorts feature on mobile. It is beginning to ruin Youtube for me personally as you unconsciously get caught up in the Youtube shorts stream more and more. It does so by remembering if the last video you have seen is a Youtube Short. If so, the next time you open the app, even if completely closed, it reopens immediately into a Youtube Shorts stream. If left in any other view inside the app, the app will open the homepage instead. Due to the increasing amount of Shorts available, the chances are that you are caught up in the stream sooner or later. When you finally come to your senses you simply close the app. When restarting the app, bam you’re in again…<p>---<p>By now, we all know the buzzing feeling you experience in your head due to an overload of dopamine when you finally end your streak of swiping away short high-intensity videos. Be it in TikTok, Youtube shorts, or another similar platform that copied the aforementioned first one.<p>Personally, I am not a big fan of this format as it simply is too addicting, messes with my head, and eats up valuable time. Its algorithm mixes a lot of mediocre to bad stuff with actually good content for maximum viewing time. On Youtube, when not making use of youtube premium, you are sure to be served some additional ads apart from those not already embedded within the videos of content creators.<p>If I am honest, sometimes it is fun to get caught up, plus there is some quality content at times. However, that dopamine rush you get isn’t completely giving you the freedom of choice. It seems to create a new rush every time before the critical cooldown threshold is reached to take the more conscious decision of saying “now it has been enough”.<p>Even though I decided to uninstall TikTok after experiencing it briefly when it launched, it has now come to the app in which I view most of my content, that app being Youtube. That alone wouldn’t have been a problem, wasn’t it for the fact that the mobile Youtube app now actively tries to let you get caught up in that stream of Youtube Shorts. So much so that it actually distracts me away from the content I come to Youtube for in the first place…<p>It does so by remembering if the last video you have seen is a Youtube Short. If so, the next time you open the app, even if completely closed, it reopens immediately into a Youtube Shorts stream. If left in any other view inside the app, the app will open the homepage instead. Due to the increasing amount of Shorts available, the chances are that you are caught up in the stream sooner or later. When you finally come to your senses you just close the app, it being the only option to prevent the loop from continuing. When restarting the app, bam you’re in again… Feel free to give it a try yourself.<p>Not to say, the short video format doesn’t have its place or its qualities. I just don’t like the way they are being served currently next to other longer-form quality content. In my opinion, this is a chance for Youtube to be the better and more ethical video platform.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
