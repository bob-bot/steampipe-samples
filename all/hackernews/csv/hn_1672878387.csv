My goal was to create the fastest p2p content transfer site. It&#x27;s a free site that allows anyone to send files p2p files. No signups needed. User can send a file anywhere in not more that 3 clicks.<p>It was a project that grew and gained some traction. I got feedback from customers who loved the simplicity.<p>Naturally, as it grew I needed to pay the bills for hosting and my DNS (about $20&#x2F;month). This is where my difficulty began. Initially, I was able to accept stripe payments but then that got abruptly canceled. Stripe will not allow me accept payments, Google will not allow me to host ads, And apple will not allow me to distribute my app in the app store. I get vague reasons ranging from violation of TOS , hidden features in app, poor performance. I&#x27;m a solo developer and my app is far from perfect but it&#x27;s very frustrating that I&#x27;ll will be unable to generate any income to keep the service going even though it used by thousands of users. I&#x27;m old enough to remember a time when you could host ads on a self hosted blog without so much bureaucracy. It&#x27;s troubling how centralized the internet has become over the years.<p>Are there any alternative tools for monetization that early stage founders can use? Essentially, in my business model, the site is free to use, but users can purchases namespace that they can own to transfer content. I&#x27;d would like a simple payment provider that can facilitate this.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;ve been looking for the past several months to create the same thing, but with teeth for a continuous 50 meter length. I would use these blades in a manner like a bandsaw, but without being in a closed loop. I previously worked on a &quot;CNC scrollsaw&quot; (google-able) and this new blade would power that machine&#x27;s successor.<p>I&#x27;ve brainstormed and refined many ideas on in-house (DIY) manufacturing, outsourcing, and some combination.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve tried contacting:<p>* The 3 well known manufacturers of these blades: 1 got a prototype to me before saying no (the prototype had teeth, then gap with no teeth, then teeth, etc). 1 said no. 1 had no response<p>* A reseller of these blades who then asked one of the same manufacturers, but got the same response<p>* Umpteen companies on Alibaba, few leads, no winners<p>* Multiple manufacturers that do punch &amp; die work, varying levels of no or no response<p>* A manufacturer that does reel to reel etching, still in discussion, but seems unlikely<p>* Multiple manufacturers that do custom CBN form wheels for grinders. skeptical responses and I would need a good spindle to run them<p>* A manufacturer that makes a fairly similar product to what I&#x27;m looking for, just in slightly larger size, but they said no<p>* A discord of machinists, who had some helpful tips, but no leads<p>* Steel suppliers for the raw material (flat wire&#x2F;ribbon is likely the best), but obtaining small (ie &lt; 1 ton) amounts has not been fruitful<p>I think the DIY approach is not impossible for someone with more skills and better space+equipment than me. A 50m length has about 25,000 teeth, so whatever process it is (milling, punching, grinding, &lt;something else&gt;), it needs to be repeatable. The best idea I&#x27;ve had is a purpose built CNC grinder with computer vision for wear compensation and alignment, but a major hurdle with grinding is the corner radius would ideally be &lt;150 um (300 um tooth height, so that leaves half the height as flat). I could ramble about more specifics, but maybe that gives a bit of flavor and intrigue if someone is interested in working on this.<p>Thanks!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
