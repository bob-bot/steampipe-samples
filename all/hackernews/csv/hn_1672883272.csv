The conversations start something like this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;z6GUTGc Yup, you guessed it, they have the idea and we have to implement it. They don&#x27;t even have the dataset. One guy proposed my friend that he has a startup idea to use GPT-model to let people talk to their pets and that it should be &#x27;fairly easy&#x27; to finetune from an existing model.<p>I am already fairly tired of seeing all the ChatGPT stuff on my socials, and I am not looking forward to another few years of more low effort&#x2F;low quality stuff in peak of inflated expectations phase. I love GPT, I have many pipelines where I actively use it, but I also see the potential where people will abuse it, in every form from  increased spam, personalized phishing, etc. Imagine scammers calling your grand parents not with an non-native accent anymore - heck maybe with your own voice (which in my head is fairly easy to do - get someone&#x27;s family tree, call the grandkid using a model fine-tuned on some local accent, perhaps of the opposite gender and engage them in a conversation - use the voice clips to finetune another model and then call their parents&#x2F;grandparents to get money, heck even the transcript for the scam interaction can be auto-generated). I am a first-generation college student, and getting my parents to use a smartphone has itself been a challenge - there&#x27;s no way I can teach them to identify sophisticated scams.
