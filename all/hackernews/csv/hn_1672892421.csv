All the better when other people think it&#x27;s true too. What are your favorite misconceptions about computers?<p>Some that come to mind for me are:<p>(1) The idea that relational databases are named &quot;relational&quot; because they allow you to represent relationships between tables. Actually, &quot;relational&quot; refers to the fact that they are modeled as relations (aka tables). A relational database would be just as relational if it was only capable of storing a single table.<p>(2) The idea that HTTP &quot;packets&quot; are the same sort of thing as TCP packets. I used to imagine HTTP headers being attached to the beginning of every TCP packet when communicating over HTTP. Of course TCP doesn&#x27;t present a &quot;packet&quot; interface at all. It&#x27;s just a stream of bytes, so an HTTP packet is just a division within the stream of bytes, defined by the Content-Length header.<p>(3) The term C in ACID and the C in CAP refer to the same concept of consistency. Actually, ACID consistency is a single-node property, whereas CAP consistency is a multi-node property. One is about maintaining uniqueness and foreign key constraints, whereas the other is about making a multi-node system appear to behave like a single-node system.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
