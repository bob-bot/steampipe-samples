I am losing my motivation to keep going. This probably isn&#x27;t burn out, as my job has been surprisingly relaxed for the last year. I like most of my colleagues. Just not enthused to build one more sklearn model. I could switch companies and that might excite me for a few weeks or months, but I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s it.<p>I don&#x27;t have the personality or desire to be a people manager or a PM. I like to do the thing not manage the people doing the thing. I&#x27;ve tried managing and the results haven&#x27;t been great. At the same time, I&#x27;m not very interested in the engineering side of DS work. So I&#x27;m guessing DE, MLE, and SWE  positions are not a great fit.<p>I&#x27;ve thought about teaching. I have a PhD and was on the tenure track for awhile. But no R1 university would hire me at this age. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d even get the reference letters to finish an application. The workload also seems insane. My friends in academia are miserable. (Side note: how and why did we as a society ruin that job?). The idea of teaching at a teaching college or high school appeals to me in theory. But then I think about the change in salary.<p>So what comes next?  Maybe try to make a small startup?  Maybe switch to carpentry or farming?  Tough it out for another decade until I can retire?  What do people do after they get bored of tech?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
