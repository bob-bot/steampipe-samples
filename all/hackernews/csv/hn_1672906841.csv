I spent so much time iterating on my CV, trying to find the perfect way to present my experiences and skills. It was really hard to sell myself, and I found it really stressful trying to come up with the perfect bullet points for my resume.<p>It was during this time that the idea for Resume Studio came to me. I realized that so many people must be going through the same struggles I was, and I wanted to help them. So, I decided to create a service that would help people create powerful, effective resumes that would help them land the job they wanted. And then I discovered GPT-3 and all the mind blowing stuff that can come out of It, and I figured It could be a great help in that matter.<p>Resume Studio is now on Its first iteration and there&#x27;s a lot of fun and exciting functionalities&#x2F;ideas that are soon coming. And I&#x27;m happy to get your feedbacks and suggestions",story,https://resumestudio.careers,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
