I have done quite well so far, but I&#x27;m getting a bit exhausted by trying to continuously justify my worth \ existence as an IC and ensure people perceive my work as good \ important.<p>As I&#x27;ve seen my friends move around to other companies I&#x27;ve gotten the sense that engineers at other companies don&#x27;t really have to deal with this sort of anxiety as much, either because expectations are more concrete (&quot;we need these things done\designed\scoped out and you&#x27;re working on it&quot;) or because performance reviews are just not so intense.<p>With recent layoffs and the direction of the company I am thinking about trying to move around, maybe to a smaller company. From a personal perspective, performance culture is one of the things I have come to dislike most about this company, although maybe it&#x27;s like this most places.<p>Is it like this elsewhere?
