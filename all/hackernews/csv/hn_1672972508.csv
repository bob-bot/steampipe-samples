34270069,Login Screen that promotes artists,2023-01-06T02:12:43Z,oblib,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I have friends and family who are artists and, honestly, most of them
are very talented. They all would like to sell their art but none of them spend any time at all on that. They just keep making more art.<p>The other day I was working on the design code to update the login screen on an app I make and couldn&#x27;t help but think &quot;this is really boring&quot;. That led me to ponder if there was a way to make it more fun, or at least somewhat interesting, for users and it occurred to me that putting a random background image of art on that screen might actually do that.<p>So I did a search for some example js code that does this and found some to start hacking with to implement that &quot;feature&quot;, and I think it&#x27;s pretty cool.<p>While testing it I found it a bit mesmerizing. I just kept clicking &quot;Reload&quot; to see what would come up next and there&#x27;s an uplifting feeling I got when a painting came up that appealed to me. I&#x27;d like to think that would happen to users of my apps.<p>Adding a link to the artist&#x27;s website or contact info on that login screen might even help them sell some art without having to even think about promoting it.<p>I&#x27;ve already implemented this in the next update to one of my apps and it will be interesting to see how users respond to it.<p>Of course, my little web apps won&#x27;t do much for artists but since this is such a simple thing to implement I think it&#x27;s worth putting it out there for others to consider.<p>If you&#x27;re interested you can check out a simple single page demo I made at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azartiz.com&#x2F;logindemo.html. Just reload the page to go through the images. There are around 40 it will randomly choose one from.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
