Or has solar panels glued&#x2F;mounted, I found these that can&#x27;t possibly be legitimate they seem so light:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Solar-Panel-Flexible-Monocrystalline-Photovoltaic&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B0BNVLXKN1&#x2F;ref=psdc_2236628011_t1_B0BC96BWGT?th=1<p>- so two of those would be 3.3 feet long, 21 inches wide (maybe room for three of them widthwise, 32 inches isn&#x27;t even three feet), and really small. Basically, tow a long cooler with those glued on.<p>- even if 2-3 x 200 watt rated panels only return 50% in practice... that 200-300 watts, that would probably triple or quadruple the all-electric range of the bike maybe even perpetual, and the rider can toss in more wattage as desired. Even a lazy crank from a reasonably healthy human is almost 100 watts.<p>- heck you could add more batteries or extra batteries to the rear trailer, lots of room to haul camper equipment and rain gear<p>- the panels are DC, the batteries are also DC usually with an AC adapter, why invert to AC from the panels so the charger can re-invert for the battery, are there DC &quot;adapters&quot; for things like this?<p>- you could always tow two trailers for even more...<p>- obviously you don&#x27;t want the panels to be 100 pounds, but those linked panels seem to just be 2 pounds each, and there are DC-DC vanlife inverters that weight 4 pounds. What else would you need besides a cable to the ebike battery charge port?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
