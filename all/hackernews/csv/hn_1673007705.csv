In past I just followed a rule to buy insurance in a country of residence, but today my situation is little more difficult since I have  Russian passport. I left when war began, not going back there and I have no idea where I gonna live in 3 months. Unfortunately option of using insurance from a credit card company or a bank wont work for me even though I have UK bank account. Sadly their insurance only work for UK residents.<p>This is why I decided to ask about it on HN. I sure some digital nomads out there likely had some experience with health and travel insurance while having vague residency.<p>PS: For now I do work full time for a small company based in Estonia (founder is in Switzerland) so if someone know of options that my company can pay for this also gonna be useful.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
