This idea occurred to me yesterday sometime and I&#x27;d like someone with more knowledge to check me on this.<p>Generally, ChatGPT and GPT models run on a user-input based cycle; the user prompts and the AI computes and replies.<p>What if, instead, we gave one of these neural networks arbitrary input from the real world? Like an audio&#x2F;video stream? Or a voice to text input from a busy cafe? Or something like that? What if we allowed the network to fire&#x2F;compute at the rate a human brain fires&#x2F;computes?<p>It seems to me that the idea of general intelligence is a far cry from where AI is right now partially because of its operating conditions. That is, humans being generally intelligent (arguable in some cases :D), operate in fundamentally different conditions from how we allow AI to operate. We receive real-time data from a number of sources and process that data in real-time. ChatGPT fires its neural net once every prompt.<p>Would there be an advantage to setting up something like chatGPT to operate similarly to humans? Allow it to &quot;think&quot;, to interact with the world in real time.<p>What would an AI&#x27;s internal dialogue look like? Could we allow it to talk to itself? This poses interesting questions about being able to identify the sources of prompts; is it me (the AI) thinking this thought? Or is someone else injecting these thoughts? Is there a procedural difference between &quot;internal dialogue&quot; and other kinds of signal processing?<p>I don&#x27;t know of a better place to ask these questions.
