(Lockpicking, penetration testing, Tang Soo Do... you know, typical &quot;IT stuff&quot;.)<p>I&#x27;m about to pay the bare minimum on my secured card through the credit union account I opened during my aborted PhD.<p>Should I stand up a website on the domain, blog about technical topics, and continue this charade of &quot;looking for work&quot;?<p>Or sell it and exit the United States, having accomplished my &quot;stay behind mission&quot;?<p>At one point, a nonprofit told me they&#x27;d help me avoid having my lease illegally ended and connect me with something called &quot;ERAP&quot; to pay my rent until the pandemic was over, when I could safely and leisurely look for a new apartment, having moved out of said abusive enviornment prior to COVID falling. When that payment didn&#x27;t come, I had to sell out of my IRA -- and I used some of those coerced funds to verify I&#x27;m eligible for an Italian passport, so emigration, with zero intent to return to the USA is on the table.<p>When I was having insurrectionists stalk me, I took a look at some guns down at the Pittsburgh Waterfront&#x27;s Dick&#x27;s -- and very purposefully decided to get a medical marijuana card instead.<p>However, folks inside and outside the dispensary refused to follow the guidlines, which is a trigger for someone on the autistic spectrum -- it felt like I was back at the approved private school that I wrote about. (In fact, I ran into at least one of my old teachers at the dispensary, and another I saw on the TV running up on the capital on January 6th).<p>I&#x27;m sorry if this post comes across as entitled, but I worry sometimes that people are not registering that I feel trapped behind enemy lines. This is not a movie or TV show, and if it was it would not be The Perks of Being a Wallflower <i>or</i> Mr. Robot.<p>(It&#x27;d be more like a mix of &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; and &quot;The Americans&quot;, the latter of which I hadn&#x27;t seen until quite recently.)<p>TL;DR: What should I do with dontbenebby.com, dontbenebby.org, and dontbenebby.net -- use them or sell it? I&#x27;m happy to go into more detail if needed or if the above was unclear. (I&#x27;m good at writing, not editing... you can only do so much by yourself.)<p>Sincerely,

www.work-closer.com<p>Value prop: 
Communicate like you&#x27;re in the same room.<p>or in short: Be together, anywhere.<p>The core ideas that when you have presence and context about what your team does, it&#x27;s easier to have a quick conversation and collaborate. Same as when you sit in the same room with your co-founders or colleagues. Things just move faster than pure async and meetings.<p>Despite our initial users loving it and using it constantly, we have a hard time getting new teams onboarded. 
There is a fear of being on video (we&#x27;re working on this), but my feeling was always that it&#x27;s not much different from being in the office.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback on 
1) first impression.  
2) why or why not this would be great for you.   
3) concerns just looking at it.<p>Thanks for your support
