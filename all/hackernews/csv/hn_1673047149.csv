34282236,Dear Fellow Information Hoarders – Join Me,2023-01-06T22:31:48Z,dbodin11,2,false,false,<null>,[34282290],<null>,<null>,<null>,"TLDR: I read a lot. You read a lot. Let&#x27;s highlight and share what we read together.<p>I&#x27;m a fellow information hoarder. I had long work commutes on public transit, so I used my passive time to read and learn everyday to try and grow 1% each day.<p>I used GMail drafts body to save links and the subject as searchable tags. I saved thousands of entries this way before I noticed two things: 1.) I&#x27;m actually interested in only a few parts of each link and want an easy way to return to those parts in the future, and 2.) I wish I could see the parts of links other dedicated readers found useful which would both help discover quality resources and save time with highlights acting as a preview or summary.<p>So I actually built a social annotation web overlay that saves to a web app that&#x27;s both an aggregator and social network: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kontxt.io&#x2F;. I publicly share most of what I read and highlight on my profile https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kontxt.io&#x2F;profiles&#x2F;d.<p>Hacker News is one of my seed sites I visit multiple times a day, so I created a group for myself and other HN readers to see people&#x27;s highlights of links on HN: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kontxt.io&#x2F;groups&#x2F;23423&#x2F;documents. Feel free to join and share your highlights, or just quickly view all the best parts of the links on HN highlighted by others.<p>It would bring me no greater joy than to see the hundreds of thousands of lines of code I&#x27;ve developed over six years be used to unite avid readers on HN and fellow information addicts to learn and grow together as a community. Stay curious--and keep reading!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
