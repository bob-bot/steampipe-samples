Every single article here is just about how we have to make X illegal or else something bad will happen. By the same logic, tinkering with computers should have been illegal or the companies would have gone broke. Simple. You are brain damaged, obsessed people. The only merit of this forum is the occasional neat proof of concept software that gets posted, which has almost nothing to do with 99.999% of the users here who make web shit for a living.<p>And you are always complaining about how your web shit job is threatened. Why is everyone here more into the nuances of regulation than software engineering? You&#x27;re constantly wrong on anything technical. I&#x27;m seeing people here who think fail2ban makes or breaks network security. How is it that you people think you&#x27;re special when we can look at any general software product and see that it&#x27;s egregiously broken on all fronts and even invents new fronts to be broken on (especially if it&#x27;s embedded). The numbers don&#x27;t match up. Like those Samsung Smart TVs with terrible menus that barely work. Web app on the other hand just means broken, I have no idea why this is not treated as an axiom in discussions here aside from you being the people who make the average website that not even my mom can use without cringing.<p>I state that car firmware is all broken because I know because I know the general software industry, and I don&#x27;t even need to look into it to prove myself right. People disagree with me. The next day hundreds of vulns are disclosed across the entire vehicle industry. How many times do you people need to relearn the basic facts about how this industry works? Every single article I ever had here is like I&#x27;m talking to a 1 year old who never saw what the real software industry is like. But the most annoying thing of all is how you&#x27;re all extremely sensitive to making basic freedoms legal when you have no idea how any of the things your regulating work.<p>I really want to bring home this point here. All HNers care about is making new laws for ultra ad-hoc things. I can&#x27;t even follow it because it moves so fast. It&#x27;s all garbage, though. Like I don&#x27;t even agree with antitrust legislation back in the day. It&#x27;s not like if Microsoft got their way, I would have become a Microsoft dev.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
