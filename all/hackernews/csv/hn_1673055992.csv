34284055,Poll HN: Would you use an anonymous web and forum?,2023-01-07T01:35:41Z,uconnectlol,1,false,false,2,[34284095],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Imagine someone made a good web replacement like Freenet that&#x27;s anonymous and P2P (and of course uncensorable). But it&#x27;s fast and not written by script kiddies. Hypertext based but isn&#x27;t buggy like the web. You open up an article and instantly get text, images, and videos, and can even right click and save them. Any content you post is seamlessly distributed across nodes as it gets more demand. All content is static and therefore the user interface is always consistent and fast.<p>Now at some point it has as much topic coverage as the web. And it has search indexes that allow you to find stuff of any topic, with filters with such categories as &quot;non-commercial&quot;.<p>Would you use it?<p>Now imagine there is a forum program based on the same mechanisms: you just post the same kind of hypertext as your messages, and your posts themselves are distributed across nodes. Creating an &quot;account&quot; is just a cryptographic process. A forum topic is just a string instead a &quot;community&quot;. You can talk about whatever you want, with zero moderation. You can use a filter to remove any category of posts you don&#x27;t want to see (like spam, or Fortnite memes, or charlatans).<p>Just imagine it&#x27;s like the web but without all the bugs from 30 years of cruft, and with these enhancements above, and is proven to work perfectly.<p>I would highly want this for publishing my articles on hacking and such, and for talking to people without having to appease a moderator. And for the ability to research arbitrary topics and get pages that just load instead of considering which country I&#x27;m in or showing popups.<p>What about you? Would you actually use it? Why or why not?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
