Why? Because there&#x27;s almost no liquidity on the AWS EC2 RI Marketplace and it can take a while, if at all, to sell an RI if you need to stop using one.<p>Previous to founding Usage, I worked at JPMorgan Chase as a summer analyst.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works: We are typically brought in by a DevOps manager to cut AWS EC2 costs. The app is entirely self-service and the savings are generated automatically, typically we do this live on a call. On average, we reduce AWS EC2 spend by 50% for 5 minutes of work.<p>To reduce by 50%+, we&#x27;ve built a pool of reserved instances that&#x27;s shared across our pool of customers. When a customer scales up their EC2s, Usage buys RIs. When a customer scales down their EC2s, Usage sells RIs. At this point, we&#x27;ve saved companies tens of millions of dollars in spend and have a lot of liquidity, so we take on very little risk.<p>We make money off of a 20% Savings Fee. Happy to chat directly kaveh@usage.ai<p>Have you experienced any issues with managing your company or organization&#x27;s AWS expenses? We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and ideas!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
