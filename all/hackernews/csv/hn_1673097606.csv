34287667,Self-Modifying FPGAs?,2023-01-07T13:06:13Z,daly,3,false,false,1,[34287725],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;m working on the problem of &quot;getting it into the fingers&quot;. For example, if you learn typing you start by repeated muscle motions which you gradually learn. A similar thing happens when learning a musical instrument or woodworking.<p>In order to do this form of &quot;finger learning&quot; I start with a state machine encoding the initial actions. A JIT-like mechanism recognizes repeated actions, collects up the sequence, optimizes the total sequence, and then creates a new additional state, thus &quot;getting things into the fingers&quot;.<p>Ideally I&#x27;d like an FPGA that could dynamically self-modify. It would be able to change lookup tables (LUTS) and pathways within itself, thus changing the recognized state logic.<p>The only path I know about would be to change the RAM that holds the initial state and then reboot.<p>That path requires deep knowledge of the binary blob that gets loaded when creating the FPGA design.<p>Changing that binary blob, as far as I know, involves going back to a Verilog compile and then through tools to do place-and-route, etc. This tedious path is my current effort.<p>So the question is: Is there an FPGA capable of directly self-modifying by writing LUTS or by writing RAM?<p>Ideally this self-modifying FPGA would have an embedded hard processor (RISC-V) that could read&#x2F;write LUTS and pathways in the rest of the FPGA. The hard processor would run self-aware tasks like the JIT.<p>I know Intel has a CPU&#x2F;FPGA combination (only available to data center scale vendors unfortunately) that MIGHT be able to self-optimize repeated instruction paths. This might be difficult on an X86 architecture but it might be reasonable on a RISC-V architecture which allows non-standard instructions.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
