Codeacademy has some drawbacks:<p>- No interactive shell&#x2F;REPL&#x2F;console<p>- No debuggers<p>- Basic error tracebacks not suitable for beginners<p>- No stdin, i.e. no input() so you can&#x27;t write interactive programs, and no pdb.<p>- No gradual guidance when you&#x27;re stuck. You can get one big hint, then the full solution in one go. This is not effective for learners having difficulty.<p>- Still on Python 3.6 (futurecoder is on 3.10)<p>I am obviously biased, but I truly believe futurecoder is the best resource for adult beginners. The focus on debugging tools, improved error messages, and hints empowers learners to tackle carefully balanced challenges. The experience of learning feels totally different from other courses, which is why I claim that if someone wants to start learning how to code, futurecoder is the best recommendation you can make.",story,https://futurecoder.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
