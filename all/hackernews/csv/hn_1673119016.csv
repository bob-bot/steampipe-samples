Clearly it is a novel puzzle that has never been posed and is not in the training set: it&#x27;s a nonsense question correctly answered.  Although the answer clearly shows ChagGPT reasoning correctly, it still shows it lacks a true deep understanding. For example, it does not consider that the question is totally absurd, it does not mention that lobsters live in water and are tiny compared with humans. Its focus on claws is irrelevant.<p>And yet it shows true thinking ability. This is why it does as well as an average high school student on the SAT, and is able to complete medical tests similar to average medical students.  Logically speaking, the only way other than through general intelligence for that to be possible, is if passing a medical school test at an average level did not require general intelligence and could be done by mere statistical guesswork.<p>That does not make much sense.<p>Examples like the post I am sharing and thousands of others shows that ChatGPT has an ability to engage in generic reasoning tasks, occasionally successfully.
