I learned a ton and I think it has some neat little features to show:<p><pre><code>    - It&#x27;s a React application written in TypeScript using Parcel[1].
    - No back-end. Data is shared via WebRTC directly between connected browsers. I&#x27;m using Yjs[2] to help me with that.
    - Synchronized timer and YouTube player (audio only).
    - It isn&#x27;t responsive yet and lacks some polishing but I did put several hours on tweaking the UI. Things like volume slider being logarithmic instead of linear, high precision timer display using request animation frame (so no longer&#x2F;shorter seconds) and force&#x2F;sensitivity aware volume scrolling with both mouse wheel and trackpad, among others.
</code></pre>
I started using it in my current job and my team is super happy with the experience. Still have some work left to do though:<p><pre><code>    - Actions and comments.
    - Different user roles, so only select people can control the timer, music, etc.
    - Data export.
</code></pre>
Feel free to leave feedback here or on GitHub[3]. Perhaps it could be helpful to you as well. Cheers!<p><pre><code>    1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parceljs.org&#x2F;

Essentially which languages could you have separate teams work on plugins&#x2F;libraries that could be used and those users would be forced to only use the public interfaces of the library.<p>Programmers would be hard pressed to access private functions&#x2F;classes&#x2F;data inside the library, and wouldn&#x27;t be able to compile a bespoke version of the code for themselves.  Thus giving you some of the benefit of microservices.<p>Does go and rust have tooling to allow for the distribution of compiled libraries?  Or do you have to just use git sub modules to share compiled artifacts?<p>C and C++ just force you to distribute DLLs - which I suppose you can do by pushing DLLs to a git submodules and have users access them when they compile them.<p>This is a document I&#x27;d like to keep track of and update as comments come in.
