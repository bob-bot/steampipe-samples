I have emails and other things which would be super embarrassing for them.<p>I decided to leave it alone. But the post traumatic stress of what they did to me keeps coming back. I have anger flashes that are intense. It has probably permanently damaged me emotionally and threw a serious disruption into my career.<p>I am very seriously considering nuking them in the press. And I wasn’t the only one they did it to. I believe they took an approach to try to use harassment to persuade people to quit versus layoffs.<p>I know if I talk to others, they will just say; “oh bro get a therapist LOL that will fix it.”<p>On the other hand, what they did was deeply wrong, it seems wrong for me to let it go and I should take this through to its natural conclusion.<p>If you are going to treat people
Like garbage, you deserve what happens next.<p>For people who are going to respond and be like “oh just see a therapist,” you have to understand that being haunted for years by the incredible stress has been debilitating. I feel I deserve retribution. They have this coming.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
