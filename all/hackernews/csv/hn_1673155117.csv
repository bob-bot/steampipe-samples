In other words, the C# diminished chord would be borrowed from the parallel minor key, which is a common technique used in music composition to add interest and variety to the harmonies. However, it is also possible that the C# diminished chord could be used as a passing chord or a temporary tonicization (temporarily establishing a new key center) in the F major song, in which case it would not necessarily be considered a borrowed chord.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
