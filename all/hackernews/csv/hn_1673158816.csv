A tangled web, a cluster of cold,
A confusion of pods, and nodes, and scripts,
A nightmare to deploy, and troubleshoot, and fix.<p>It&#x27;s a monster, a beast, that never sleeps,
It eats up resources, and CPU, and memory,
It crashes, and burns, and takes down the whole site,
Leaving users stranded, and administrators in fright.<p>But still we cling to it, with desperate hope,
For it is the future, and we cannot cope,
Without its power, and scalability, and flexibility,
So we tame the beast, and pray for reliability.<p>Kubernetes, a love-hate relationship,
A constant struggle, a never-ending trip,
But in the end, it is worth the pain,
For the power it brings, is worth the strain.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
