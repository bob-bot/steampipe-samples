Not the “name+tag” stuff, but by moving the dot in “first.last” to different positions, or by adding a dot in mailboxes that were just a handle.<p>This has become awkward because I am getting everything from invoices (from other countries) to medical exam results with very personal data, as well as dozens of website sign-ups of various kinds - some definitely seedy and that I don’t want to be associated with at all.<p>I have done all the usual things: replied to threads - when they existed - pointing out mistaken addresses, tried to suss out the true recipient and get in contact with them so they update their e-mail address, etc. and have stopped short of actually going in and removing my e-mail from those services or disabling them because some were obviously important (like a mobile pre-paid account), but it’s been a decade of this sheer incompetence and I have to wonder why Google hasn’t bothered to actually fix their e-mail address handling to properly match the aliases I have defined and use a “.” as a significant character.<p>The thing that really gets to me is that even if the e-mail address isn’t validated, many sites just keep spamming you until you visit again, which means I get more spam every time each “mistake” happens.<p>Anyone have insights as to why this incompetence has lingered on?<p>Better still, can Google be held liable for any legal or privacy damages from this whatsoever, so they have a financial motive to fix it?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
