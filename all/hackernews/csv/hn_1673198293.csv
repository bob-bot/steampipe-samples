My name is Peter and I just launched my first-ever App in Google Play after learning to design and code for the past 9-10 months!<p>I launched a free App called Clever Plant app. An app that helps you grow plants and connect you with a plant-loving community.<p>Basically, I come from a family of florists. For my entire life, I have been dealing with everyone asking me how to take care of some random plants, and I got fed up with it.<p>One day when I was thinking about startup ideas something clicked - let’s create an app that helps you grow plants together with an exciting plant-loving community! Growing your plants doesn&#x27;t have to be boring so let me try to change this.<p>And so the Clever Plant idea has been born.<p>After listening to a bunch of Y combinator lessons to learn how to validate the idea and research the competition I and my friends got to work and start learning how to design and code.<p>As we started with big dreams and a million features we want to add to our app, we soon realized how hard building an app is with zero tech knowledge.<p>But long story short, here we are! The app is live and ready to use, albeit with much fewer features than we initially planned to add!<p>This is our first version of the Clever Plant App, and we are eager to hear your feedback!<p>The link:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.app.cleverplant",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
