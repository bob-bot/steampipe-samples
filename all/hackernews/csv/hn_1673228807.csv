I considered adding a SaaS I&#x27;ve run on the side for a year or so now. It&#x27;s gained me a _ton_ of skills about Linux management, containerization, web servers, etc - I&#x27;ve rounded my sysadmin knowledge considerably.<p>However, as I&#x27;ve marked the work experience as &quot;ongoing&quot; on my resume and various forms, I&#x27;m afraid some reviewers may look negatively upon a &quot;current job&quot; like that, which may require constant work - perhaps they see it as a possible interruption of the internship. I&#x27;ve got a research lab as well on my resume, but those don&#x27;t imply working over the summer. I hope they&#x27;d be reasonable about knowing that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with work (it requires nearly no maintenance), but perhaps something like this is considered poorly especially for a student summer internship. They might want a majority of my time and for me to avoid distractions like managing a business. Any thoughts on the matter?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
