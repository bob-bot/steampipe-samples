34308685,Ask HN: My son (9yo) wants to learn to develop games,2023-01-09T10:07:27Z,cx42net,1,false,false,1,[34308728],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi!<p>My 9 yo son wants to learn to develop games, and, as I developer myself, I&#x27;m more than happy to help him on this road.<p>I could start with the programming basics, the rendering loop and iterate from this, but it is quite complicated and will take quite some time before having some significant results.<p>Another approach would be to start by having to resolve gaming puzzle that requires development, starting with very easy levels and increasing in complexity. At some point (and if he follows through), he will have enough knowledge to be able to handle the complexity and the underlying of what a games is made of.<p>Another issue I&#x27;m facing is that we are French. It&#x27;s a requirement for us to use resources in French for now as he improves his English along the way.<p>Here&#x27;s what I thought I could do:<p>1. I thought about doing the learning myself, implement a course he could follow with increasing complexity. But I know myself. I&#x27;m not great on sharing knowledge, and I would dive too deep in complexity. Moreover, it would take time before having visual results (which is what he is looking for, of course), and might probably loose interest before having valuable results.
2. I thought about subscribing to online courses (Udemy, Coursera, etc) about game development. Problem is most of the courses are about Unity and C#. We are not there yet. (and not too many in French).
3. My best scenario for now is to create an account at either [CodingGame](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codingame.com&#x2F;) or [CodeCombat](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codecombat.com). They apparently have a French version and hopefully the beginning would be not that hard. And since it&#x27;s coding, I could help him.
4. Turn to HN and ask for better suggestions on how to do this :)<p>Thank you for your help!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
