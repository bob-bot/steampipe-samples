- Things do not have a place where they belong and lie around at random places.
- It gets difficult to find things when needed. 
- Things can&#x27;t be identified or distinguished: Was this the unique special Adapter from connector A to connector B? Was this the graphics card with the defect which looks the same as the replacement exemplar of the same type.<p>It needs a systematic approach to restore order. It is easy to group some things of a kind and put them in a box.<p>But what do you do with all the unique things where you own only a single of it&#x27;s kind? And how do you recognize a special adapter after years, when it isn&#x27;t special from the outside? And how do you know after years which accessory belongs to which device?<p>I thought of using an inventory management system in software. Every box and every device gets labeled with a unique number. The software stores which devices is in which box. Also it could store extra information like specifications, digital manuals, drivers and it could manage a log history of a device. There you could keep information like: &quot;CPU upgraded on server.&quot;.<p>I never used an such a software but I am sure there are some commercial ones on the market for professional use in organizations. I would prefer a simple FLOSS solution for a desktop computer without the need to run a server. Also the data must be accessible for backing up.<p>How do you manage your inventory?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

  is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘window.el’.

  It is bound to C-l.

  Scroll the window so that current line is in the middle of the window.
  Successive invocations scroll the window in a cyclical order to put
  the current line at certain places within the window, as determined by
  ‘recenter-positions’.  By default, the second invocation puts the
  current line at the top-most window line, the third invocation puts it
  on the bottom-most window line, and then the order is reused in a
  cyclical manner.

  With numeric prefix ARG, move current line ARG lines below the window top.
  With plain C-u, move current line to window center.
