As in, half my browser bookmarks from three years ago just straight up don&#x27;t exist anymore. GitHub repos that are unmaintained for 8 months usually can&#x27;t be run&#x2F;build&#x2F;executed anymore, or only with a long session of hotfixing and dependency issues. Even &quot;simple&quot; projects of my own (like a jekyll site) can&#x27;t be ran anymore after a year w&#x2F;o endless dependency- and deprecation-related struggle.<p>* When trying to solve simple problems (&quot;I wish I had a program making this easier&quot;), a painful amount of development time is spent working on what <i>The Mythical Man-Month</i> calls &quot;Accidental Complexity&quot;. Configs, boilerplate, libraries. Making Heroku play nice with Docker, and make that play nice with Namecheap, and make that play nice with Stripe, and Tailwind, and LetsEncrypt...and so on.<p>So with these (maybe obvious) observations in mind, what is your recommendation for a tech-stack or paradigm better suited for small problems, MVPs, side projects, and so on?<p>I am really happy open for anything (languages, paradigms, tech, concepts, ...), the only requirements are simplicity, longevity and ability to build user-facing stuff nicely (doesn&#x27;t have to be via GUI, though).<p>Thanks a lot!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
