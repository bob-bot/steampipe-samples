I&#x27;m well aware that this is basically the opposite issue of every other HN post of a dev who wants to avoid it.<p>I&#x27;m a Midwest .NET dev (near Chicago) doing simple CRUD apps at a company here for about 3 years now. This is my first job out of college. I went back to school later in life (I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s) so I&#x27;m not exactly green when it comes to corporate politics.<p>During the time before getting my CS degree, I was scrounging to stay afloat taking whatever jobs I could. I had to develop many people skills that I often feel like are very lacking among IT individuals. I often get comments where people say &quot;You&#x27;re not like regular IT folks&quot; or something along those lines since I&#x27;m pretty social and have tons of non-computer related hobbies. That being said, I often feel like I&#x27;m not like most developers because of it. So it&#x27;s hard for me to identify with people who spend all their free time coding for FOSS or making videogames after work.<p>Knowing this, I really do feel like I&#x27;d much rather be in management. I love having long meetings, chatting with people, making decisions on what should be done, don&#x27;t mind taking over where other people messed up, setting directives, etc. If I&#x27;m coding constantly, I&#x27;m just not happy. There is nothing personal about programming and it&#x27;s not as exciting as dealing with people issues.<p>In my current position, it is very much a very traditional slow moving org with a ton of dead weight. So it&#x27;s not a hard job. But with that, it means people don&#x27;t leave as easily unless they&#x27;re pushed out the door. So it&#x27;s difficult to get a management position unless you stay long enough.<p>I am currently getting a MA in Business (not an MBA, but it&#x27;s really cheap and easy state school). I know that doesn&#x27;t do much, but I figured it was a start. Is there anything I can or should be doing? Routes I should take? Risks even?
