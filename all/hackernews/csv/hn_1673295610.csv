About 30 words per hour, most of the time. Writing is a literal mental torture for me, not because I don&#x27;t like it (I do), but because I make no progress.<p>To more clearly explain my writing &quot;process&quot;, I will usually struggle to start, until I get a small burst of [inspiration &#x2F; motivation &#x2F; productivity &#x2F; ???] (I don&#x27;t really know what) and I will be able to write a few lines, before my next productivity collapse. And then the cycle repeats all day long, where I will have bigger or smaller bursts (30 seconds to 5 minutes) where I make progress, followed by sometimes hours of inability to focus.<p>I basically get distracted all the time, by anything. Often I know what to write, but the words just refuse to come out.<p>The second thing that impairs my speed is that I want to write and format everything well right away. It&#x27;s not that I can&#x27;t draft small sections in bullet points, but if I&#x27;m writing the actual doc, it has to be perfect, otherwise I will be distracted by the extra space or the title that is formatted differently from the others.<p>Things I have tried:<p>- Putting distractions out of my reach: it doesn&#x27;t help, my mind will just go wandering,<p>- Going to the office: it&#x27;s even worse,<p>- Working with someone else next to me: no difference.<p>I am looking for suggestions of people that struggled similarly and were able to improve. For example, I remember a website that allowed you to type but not to go back more than 2 lines above to edit, which may help with drafting.<p>Thanks, and sorry for the wall of text.<p>PS: I imagine that on this kind of topics people will mention ADHD. I haven&#x27;t been assessed but I don&#x27;t think I have it. I was never great at focusing before, but I don&#x27;t remember it being such an issue in my childhood. Also it seems like it&#x27;s getting worse progressively (I&#x27;m 28).<p>PPS: As an example, it took me pretty much exactly an hour to write this post.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
