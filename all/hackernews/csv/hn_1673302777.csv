Without editor hints this was an annoyance, as I&#x27;d have to try it out, check the source, or search the docs. Such issues never happen with a functional standard library (as in Clojure) where you can always assume immutability.<p>Meanwhile in Clojure, if I&#x27;ve been gone from the language for a while I forget which list functions return a lazy sequence, a seq, or a vector, and I find myself making frustrating errors as a result. Or how some functions (like map and filter) take the collection as the last argument, and a few others take it as the first.<p>It seems like a poor standard library design requires acquiring much more &#x27;trivia&#x27; about the language to be successful, to write performant code, and (sadly) to pass many technical interviews.<p>What do you think makes a good standard library?
