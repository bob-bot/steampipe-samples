The longer the account is public, the higher I’m at risk for LGBTQ persecution in my home country.<p>When I was younger, I naively started a Quora account with my real name and photo attached. I posted answers that reveal my LGBTQ identity. Right now, I’m being recognized in my (conservative) community for an accomplishment. Someone reached out to me saying they’re confused by the posts in my Quora profile and how they go against my national identity and (assumed) religion. If the person chooses to share this profile with authorities, I’m at stake to be persecuted and possibly lose on scholarship money that helps me stay in the US. The profile page is a top search result for Googling my name, which makes me even more worried.<p>I don’t remember the email address associated with the account and I tried enumerating through all the emails I remember owning—to no avail.<p>I would appreciate all the help I can get to delete the account. Thank you all in advance.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
