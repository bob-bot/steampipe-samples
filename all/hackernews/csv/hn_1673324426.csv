The industry I am in skews older, so my team is generally unfamiliar with coding, and if they are, aren’t up to date on best practices, as it is not their primary job.<p>Our manager has a software background and has decided on Git and GitHub as the systems of record for code version control.  I have held many training sessions on these tools over my tenure (6mo), and many people caught on and can execute the procedures I established to record their changes.  However, 2 of them do not seem to be able to learn it and I am spending my day before lunch cleaning up their commits, as they work at a frenetic pace (nights, weekends, holidays) and will seemingly type any command that makes their git errors go away (liberal use of rebase skips, force pushes, etc.)<p>The problem is not necessarily how they use Git, it’s that they’re actually quite productive while creating externalities for me, who was hired to write infrastructure code.  I am considering to stop using Git altogether (or perhaps create a firewall for these two), but what system could replace it?  The “low tech” the better.  Ideally, there would be no extra software to learn.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
