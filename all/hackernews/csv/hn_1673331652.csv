Of course brute forcing keys is practically impossible, but insertion of malicious code during the image installs or updates of wallets feels to me a more likely scenario of concern.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I&#x27;ve been working on a code editor and I think that it&#x27;s mature enough to catch some interest. It&#x27;s using a custom GPU accelerated GUI written in C++. Currently implements some interesting features: LSP, terminal, auto-completion, linters, formatters, custom keybindings, plugins and more. It&#x27;s a hobby project but still intends to be an alternative to other popular code editors like Sublime, Kate, Lapce, Lite XL (and takes inspiration from them).
The project was born as a playground for the GUI I&#x27;m developing (eepp GUI) and is advanced enough to currently be my main code editor, but it&#x27;s a work in progress, and many features are still pending.
Some minor hints on how to use it:
Folders are used as project (and .gitignore is used to ignore files)
The wheel icon on the top-right has all the options you need (Ctrl&#x2F;Cmd + M to show).
Some keybidings to navigate any project (navigation is keyboard driven):
Ctrl&#x2F;Cmd + K = Locate Files
Ctrl&#x2F;Cmd + Shift + F = Global Search
Ctrl&#x2F;Cmd + Number (Go to tab #)",story,https://github.com/SpartanJ/ecode,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
