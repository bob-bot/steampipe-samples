What is inputDir variable? (I didn&#x27;t write this code, I&#x27;m learning it from a tutorial, you know tutorials don&#x27;t cover stuffs well).
What I&#x27;m not understanding is why are we setting inputDir at 0th row, 1st column? What does that mean? Can you provide some explanations with figures(if possible) about this issue?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
