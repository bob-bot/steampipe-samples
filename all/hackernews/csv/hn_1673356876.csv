The HTML file, all attachments, and a JSON data file are saved to the local filesystem for any use or simply as an archive.<p>This provides a simple way to save threads of interest without having to use a third-party app that needs access to your Twitter account (or vice-versa) and forces you to reply to the thread to &quot;unroll&quot; or otherwise save a copy.<p>By using a dedicated directory for all generated files, thread-safe can be used to maintain a local library of saved threads that can easily be searched using standard commandline tooling like (rip)grep, fzf, fd, and any other awesome tool of your choice.<p>I hope you might find it useful and I&#x27;d love to take any feedback or suggestions that might come to mind!",story,https://github.com/dkaslovsky/thread-safe,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
34324244,Show HN: I gained 50k users for my app with NO marketing,2023-01-10T13:07:09Z,tawrahim,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi Hackernews,<p>Last year around February,  I found myself having to pay contractors for various services that they provided me as I completed my new home. An occurring question that kept coming up with each conversation was - how do you want me to pay you or do you have “X” payment app on your phone that I can send the cash to?<p>I realized that some preferred Venmo, others preferred cash app - some had neither only relied on PayPal. Being the software engineer that I am, I figured why not build an app where a person can just list all their payment apps and then I can pick which ever worked for me. Similar to linktree but ONLY for payment apps<p>So I did just that, built the app - [<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paylinkz.app&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paylinkz.app&#x2F;)"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paylinkz.app&#x2F;](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paylinkz.app&#x2F;)</a> and released it to the store without any fan fare - I  didn’t even tell my close relatives because I could care less whether they used it or not. I also didn’t want any high expectations from anyone so did it in silence<p>10 months later we have 50k users with $0 spent on ads. It is worth noting that the initial audience that I had in mind were not even the people who used it the most. Today some of the use cases I have seen on the app are people using it for fund raising, mariachi bands, barber shops, landlords  and Uber drivers for collecting tips, fantasy leagues...<p>FWIW - this is not my first rodeo at building an app and I think luck must have favored me this time around. It also helps that it is something that the market needed but never had. Although I was lucky in 2022, my goal is to put some effort into marketing to see where this goes.<p>Would love some overall feedback!",story,https://paylinkz.app/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
