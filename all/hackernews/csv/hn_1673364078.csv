Bad enough that one day it made me post this on Hacker News: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34003857<p>I like tech. I like talking about tech. I like optimizing processes. But it seems like I don&#x27;t have a knack for programming, at least naturally. I&#x27;ve told by some people that I might have ADHD, though my psychologist doesn&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;ve done some online IQ tests with scores of around 97, which is less than from what I&#x27;ve googled on the average IQ of a coder being 120.<p>I&#x27;d like to have a degree in CS by the time I&#x27;m 30. Maybe a career change would be nice (I have a terrible commute right now). But my main drive to do it is... all my life I&#x27;ve been an introvert, I&#x27;ve used Linux, I&#x27;ve been in the &quot;tech-space&quot;, but I feel like my natural abilities do not commensurate to my interests.<p>I&#x27;d like to prove myself wrong, and I&#x27;m afraid that I&#x27;m already 23 years old, and if I wait more time to do it, I&#x27;m gonna regret it a lot.
