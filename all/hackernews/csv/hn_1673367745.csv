But there’s still so much untapped potential out there. ChatGPT is fun and all, but the results are very general. Performance can be significantly improved when GPT is given clear instructions for a specific use case. We believe collective learning can help advance AI text generation, so we&#x27;ve built Dinah as a platform for finding, experimenting, and sharing the best prompts. Create easy-to-use templates to share: the end users can fill them out like MADLIBS. You’ll be able to find the best, most commonly used text generations as well as the niche use-cases as well. With top templates to choose from, you can easily create high-quality content even if you’re brand-new to AI text generation.<p>Instead of paying a subscription for all these different AI apps, you just pay one subscription and Dinah handles all your text generation use-cases. This is of course, only possible with a large library of prompts, and Dinah aims to be that platform.<p>We&#x27;ve just launched today on Product Hunt!
