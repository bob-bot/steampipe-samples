34327704,Show HN: MeetPal – Zoom Meeting Assistant,2023-01-10T16:53:10Z,razitz,4,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi HN! We’re Jonathan and Raz, co-founders of MeetPal (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meetpal.co"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;meetpal.co</a>), a zoom meetings assistant that helps you identify and connect with participants in group meetings.<p>Have you ever been in a zoom meeting with multiple attendees, only to be unsure of who is who and what their role is? This can be especially frustrating when you&#x27;re meeting with prospects or other companies, as it can be difficult to remember everyone&#x27;s position and how long they are in the current role.<p>That&#x27;s where MeetPal comes in. Our platform allows you to easily identify each participant&#x27;s company and role, as well as providing quick access to their LinkedIn profile. This should help you better understand who you&#x27;re speaking to or at least save you a few clicks through google to Linkedin and open the name &amp; company directly as a query on Linkedin itself. It facilitates easier networking and follow-up.<p>But why is this important? Being able to quickly and accurately identify who you&#x27;re speaking with in a zoom meeting can help you better understand the conversation and make more informed decisions. It can also help you build stronger connections with others, as you have more context on who they are and what they do.<p>We came up with the idea for MeetPal after experiencing this problem ourselves in our own zoom meetings. For example, think about those two things: 1) It’s impossible to copy-paste the names of attendees when you&#x27;re in a meeting. 2) As funny as it sounds, it&#x27;s pretty annoying and can feel unprofessional sometimes when you get the &quot;flash&quot; on your face when you switch windows to search on Google. We saw the need for a solution that would make it easier to identify and connect with participants, and thus, MeetPal was born.<p>MeetPal&#x27;s solution is a simple yet powerful one. By integrating with LinkedIn, we are able to provide accurate and up-to-date information on each participant. This information is displayed in an easy-to-read format, so you can quickly understand who you&#x27;re speaking with.<p>But what sets MeetPal apart from other zoom meeting assistants? One key difference is our focus on user experience. With MeetPal it is easy to find the information you need directly in the Zoom client without spending time searching or moving away from the meeting itself.<p>Our goal is to make MeetPal a valuable tool for anyone looking to make the most of their zoom meetings and build stronger connections with others.<p>Thank you so much for reading! We’d love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and experiences around the problem we’re tackling and the solution we’re proposing!",story,https://www.meetpal.co/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
