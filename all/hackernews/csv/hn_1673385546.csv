The following commands will create a new signing key and configure git to sign all future commits and tags in the current repository:<p><pre><code>  signet init -s
  signet keys -c

  git config user.signingkey &lt;key id&gt;
  git config gpg.format      ssh
  git config gpg.ssh.program signet

  git config commit.gpgsign  true
  git config tag.gpgsign     true
</code></pre>
GitHub supports commit signature verification for SSH signatures, just print the public key with `signet keys -p &lt;key id&gt;` and add it to your account, and your signed commits and tags will show up as verified.",story,https://github.com/wg/signet,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
