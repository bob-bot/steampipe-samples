I lost $10,000 in USDT, $9,000 in bitcoin and $20,000 in Eth totalling $39,000. I was left devastated and the first thing I thought of was report to the police but nothing was done. My last resort was to employ this specialist [SCEPTER007 @ WORKMAIL . COM]. After much discussion on my situation and explaining of how he works, that for sure gave me hope that he could help me. I provided details and screenshots of the transactions I made to the scammers and using these he traced my funds. I was able to recover 80% of my losses and we are currently pursuing the rest. I am eternally grateful. I recommend him to any person who has fallen prey to any online trading scam.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
