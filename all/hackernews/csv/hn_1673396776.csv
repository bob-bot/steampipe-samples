There are already thousands of B12 supplements, which all seem to be working differently. High dosing B12 seems to facilitate cancer when you already have sufficient B12. I seems like I need to consume small doses. 3 times a day a bit, because the digestive system can only process so much at a time. Most supplements I found seem to work differently, why? how? which one?<p>Then nutrients.
There are lists of nutrients to watch. 
My idea was to go through each nutrient and find dishes for them (i.e. dishes containing certain green stuff, corn and nuts, etc.) or create them by myself (yeah no way) and eat as much as required for each nutrient.<p>However it feels like I end up with way more food I could eat and it is really complicated. e.g. when I want to gain iron I shouldn&#x27;t drink tea or other things, because it makes iron reception more difficult. For other things, the opposite is true.
Already eating a for a day or week feels like it requires a scientific project in planning, and at the end of the day I need to make the things I eat, too while still having time for other things.<p>any tips?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
