I&#x27;m sharing my view on this and want to see others&#x27; perspectives and advice.<p>Ever since trying out ChatGPT I&#x27;ve been getting increasingly anxious and even depressed. I have found my interaction with it to be more insightful, creative and knowledgeable than with the majority of people I&#x27;ve met. Even when it comes to software engineering, ChatGPT has shown more understanding, patience and insight than most of my colleagues (maybe that&#x27;s more descriptive of the people I&#x27;ve encountered throughout my career, YMMV). I&#x27;ve done &quot;pair programming&quot; with it with great success. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether it has consciousness or &quot;understanding&quot; (whatever that might be) of its input and output, the results it produces isn&#x27;t that different from that of a junior developer&#x27;s (again, from my experience).<p>Now, I don&#x27;t want to argue about ChatGPT&#x27;s merits and its future potential – I&#x27;m not an ML researcher and neither are probably the vast majority of people on HN. I&#x27;m genuinely convinced that there&#x27;s far more to come in the nearest future, and ChatGPT is just an inflection point on our path to AGI.<p>My question is: what action should I take, right now, an undergrad, a CRUD &quot;engineer&quot;, to prepare myself for the near future where I have to compete with not only my fellow flesh-and-bone software engineers, but now also a gigantic language model trained on the entire human body of knowledge by hundreds of smartest minds in the world? Should I run headlong into ML research and just try to join the minds behind the AGI of the future? Should I get into some esoteric niche software engineering area which is unlikely to be automated away in the near future (and if so, which)? Maybe I should quit software engineering altogether and aim for something hands-on, lab-based, like electrical engineering or physics research?<p>Thanks for any advice.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
