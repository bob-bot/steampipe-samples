I do not have any savings or assets and will be facing the prospect of sitting for interviews in the next weeks. I feel a bit directionless and lost, having coming to realize that I might not be going high up the career ladder considering where I am. The posts about cognitive decline in the 40s and 50s in the past days has only made me more anxious.<p>Quick facts:<p>- Interested in programming but my knowledge is rusty and feel I wouldn&#x27;t be able to brush my skills up for a job
- Worked in advertising for a long time in a completely different market 
- Current goals are vague, but I definitely want to save enough to pursue interests (writing) in the long-term.<p>Has anyone of you faced a similar dilemma? What did you do against it? I feel the intertia building up over time and I am afraid of being in a limbo if I don&#x27;t act soon. I do not live in the US if that helps.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

[ Sir-Dee, Sir-Day, Sir-Daw, Sird,
Seer-Dee, Seer-Day, Seer-Daw, Seerd,
Sher-Dee, Sher-Day, Sher-Daw, Sherd, ].<p>However, my preferred way is pronounce &#x27;serde&#x27; as if it were a Spanish word, like the Spanish words &#x27;ser&#x27; and &#x27;de&#x27; combined together.
