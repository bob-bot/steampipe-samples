And it is a <i>lot</i> more readable and comprehensible for a person not familiar with the tool.<p>Maybe I am the problem and I just don&#x27;t get the declarative style, where you only describe the wanted state, not the steps you take to achieve that state?<p>If we assumed by default that our cloud infrastructure provider is AWS, wouldn&#x27;t it be simple to write a shell script that would call `aws-cli` few times?<p>I came to that question, when discussing a problem my friend, a DevOps engineer, was having - he wasn&#x27;t able to get the Azure Resource Group from his `foobar.tf` files and he ended up with something like the following:<p><pre><code>    cat &lt;&lt; EOF
      {
        &quot;aksvnet&quot;: &quot;$(az resource list --resource-group $1 | grep -i \&quot;aks-vnet- | cut -d &quot;:&quot; -f2 | tr -d &#x27;&quot;, &#x27;)&quot;
      }
    EOF
</code></pre>
And what is it? It is a shell script inside of a JSON that was created in the shell! What for are these layers of abstraction? Why does he have to wrap the Resource Group name in a JSON? Why couldn&#x27;t it be just piped in plaintext format, as all the tools that try to be POSIX-compatible do?<p>UPD:
This question is for environments where all the engineers are (to some extent) familiar with %CloudProviderSDK% and bash. And, in my opinion, it&#x27;s a lot easier to pick up bash and %CloudProviderSDK%, as those are imperative therefore closer to engineers&#x27; daily routine, as opposed to Terraform&#x27;s declarative style.
