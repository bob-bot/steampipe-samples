34341782,Show HN: We’re building a gaming console for the browser,2023-01-11T17:55:13Z,kdzapp,3,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"hey all,<p>We’re excited to share bash.gg - a way to play all games on your browser. Our mission is to enable you to play games, from any device, with your friends. We&#x27;re planning on using a combination of WebGL (soon WebGPU) &amp; pixel streaming to run any game. Our product is going viral within a few school districts, here’s what we’ve built.<p>The Problem:
Poor Experiences: Mobile gaming is limited by hardware.  Most mobile games are spammy &amp; focused on optimizing value extraction. Existing web games are junk.<p>Expensive: For good games, you need a console or PC, costing $600 - $3k.<p>Not Scalable: Consoles are sold at a loss &amp; desktop computers are too expensive. Necessary hardware is increasing in size and cost. On the other hand, games continue to get more computationally expensive.<p>bash.gg:
Great Experiences: We’re bringing the best games from PC and console to your browser so you can play from any device instantly.<p>Affordable: You don’t need expensive hardware, just a stable internet connection.<p>Scalable: As games demand more resources, they’re run in the cloud. The games that don’t need all that power can run in a browser.<p>TLDR: Consoles make it difficult to play with all of your friends. If your friend has Xbox, and you have Playstation - you might not be able to play together. Having games on the browser lets anyone play, by just clicking a link. Not only that, but you can chat and play, all in one place.<p>In progress features: pixel streaming (quic + webcodecs), community features, live audio&#x2F;text chat (should release within in 2 weeks)<p>Excited to hear what you all think!",story,https://bash.gg,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34341252,Show HN: Dropbase – Stage prod tables to enable ops teams to safely make edits,2023-01-11T17:28:27Z,jimmyechan,10,false,false,2,[34341692],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN, we’re building a safe and collaborative way to edit data in your prod database. With Dropbase, a db admin can stage a prod table so that an ops&#x2F;business team can edit it using a spreadsheet-like interface.<p>The main difference in our approach is that you can easily add custom validation rules to enforce app-level data validations. After edits are made, changes can be safely merged into prod on demand!<p>Think of it as a spreadsheet + custom data validation + git for your prod tables.<p>We believe this could replace the need to (re)build admin panels or internal tools for a significant number of use cases.<p>Check the demo video in the link and let us know what you think. If you’d like early access, please reach out. We’ll prioritize users with prod Postgres databases.<p>We’d love your feedback!
- Do you experience problems getting&#x2F;editing data from business users into prod dbs? How you solve them today?
- Would you be comfortable in opening up some of your prod tables this way?
- Also, we’re trying to find a name for this kind of product instead of calling it a spreadsheet+validation+git. Open to suggestions!",story,https://www.dropbase.io/showhn,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
