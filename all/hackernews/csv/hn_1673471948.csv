I&#x27;m curious to hear your old computer virus stories - remember the days of the infamous ILOVEYOU virus or the Melissa worm? What did you do to protect your systems back then? And more importantly, why don&#x27;t we see malware outbreaks of that scale and impact today? Let&#x27;s share our memories and perspectives in the comments. Thanks in advance for your contributions!<p>There were several notable computer viruses that emerged during the period of 1989 to 1995. Some examples include:<p><pre><code>    The &quot;Jerusalem&quot; virus, which was first discovered in 1987 and was one of the first computer viruses that was able to replicate on both IBM and Macintosh computers. It was activated on Fridays the 13th and would infect .com files by appending itself to the end of the file, causing the system to crash.

    The &quot;Stoned&quot; virus, which was one of the first viruses that was able to infect the master boot record (MBR) of a computer&#x27;s hard drive. It was first discovered in 1989 and was able to spread quickly to other computers connected to the same network.

    The &quot;Michelangelo&quot; virus, which was first discovered in 1992 and was set to activate on March 6th (Michelangelo&#x27;s birthday). It was able to infect the boot sector of a hard drive and was able to cause significant damage to computer systems.

    The &quot;Concept&quot; virus which was came in 1995, it was a macro virus that infected Microsoft Word documents, it was able to spread via email or floppy disk and was able to cause significant damage by corrupting documents and data.
</code></pre>
As with viruses from 1995-2000, these early viruses were able to spread quickly and cause significant damage due to vulnerabilities in commonly used software and inadequate security practices. With the advancement in technology and security measures these type of viruses seen less often.<p>There were several notable computer viruses that emerged during the period of 1995 to 2000. Some examples include:<p><pre><code>    The &quot;Melissa&quot; virus, which was first discovered in 1999 and spread via email attachments. It caused widespread disruption to email systems and was one of the first viruses to exploit the macro capabilities of Microsoft Word.

    The &quot;ILOVEYOU&quot; virus, which was first discovered in 2000 and spread via an email message with the subject line &quot;ILOVEYOU&quot; and an attachment with a .vbs file extension. It quickly spread worldwide, causing significant damage to computer systems and networks.

    The &quot;Explore.Zip&quot; and &quot;Kak worm&quot; which where coming in 1999 and 2000 and spread via a worm that utilised the Outlook program and a vulnerability in Internet Explorer to propagate.

    The &quot;Anna Kournikova&quot; was a worm that was spread via email in 2001. It was spread as an attachment purporting to be a photograph of the tennis player Anna Kournikova.
</code></pre>
These viruses were able to spread quickly and cause significant damage due to vulnerabilities in commonly used software, lack of user awareness, and inadequate security practices.
Over time with better security practices, software patches and improve use awareness was implemented that&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t see large-scale malware outbreaks of that nature today.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
