The app had memory leaks, so we had to make sure the professor didn&#x27;t demo the app for longer than 5 minutes before the app crashed. I&#x27;ve been under the assumption that the problems of Objective-C that Swift solves was automatic garbage collection, but it seems to address a slough of other things first.<p>Any experienced SWEs who found value out of attending a bootcamp or structured course to fast track mobile app development? I&#x27;ve been able to pick up specialities in other software disciplines such as data science, backend, frontend from first hand work experience, but mobile app development is usually a silo where the teams only hire people who are already well versed in mobile app development. It feels like there are many platform specific quirks and instances of &quot;you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know&quot;, so a bootcamp would at least steer you down the happy path and from there you can start branching out and considering the tradeoffs of the happy path.<p>Our team is making vendoring decisions between React Native versus Swift&#x2F;Kotlin, the latter being outside our area of expertise to have opinions on.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
