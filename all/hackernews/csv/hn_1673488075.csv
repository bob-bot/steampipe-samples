I&#x27;ve been able to pick up specialities in other software disciplines such as data science, backend, frontend from first hand work experience, but mobile app development is usually a silo where the teams only hire people who are already well versed in mobile app development. It feels like there are many platform specific quirks and instances of &quot;you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know&quot;, so a bootcamp would at least steer you down the happy path and from there you can start branching out and considering the tradeoffs of the happy path.<p>Our team is making vendoring decisions between React Native versus Swift&#x2F;Kotlin, the latter being outside our area of expertise to have opinions on.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I began training before COVID hit, so I have perspective as someone who practiced medicine before, during, and after the pandemic. There are multiple, long-standing issues in medicine, many that have been unmasked by COVID but have been festering for a long time:<p>Doctors don’t run hospitals. Due to EMTALA, every single patient that shows up to your emergency department has to be treated. When insurance companies and private equity realized that you can’t say no to doing the work, then why should they pay you? Ultra lean staffing prior to covid led to the sh*tshow during the pandemic and, now that everyone is quitting, things are now in total collapse.<p>Go to any hospital in the country and, even if you have a serious problem like a heart attack, sepsis, a kidney stone blocking off your ureter while your kidney fills up with pus and you’re turning grey and shivering because you’re dying, well, chances are you’re going to be lying in a bed in the hallway.<p>Up in the ICU hopeless 95 year olds will sit on ventilators and other life support machines for weeks because doctors don’t have any discretion in stopping futile care. You can be a 30 year old pregnant woman, and you will die waiting for your ICU bed in the emergency room. There are 30 rooms in the ER, but 3 nurses overnight…what do you think happens if you have an accident and urinate or have a bowel movement in the bed? That’s exactly what happens.
