My issue is with the amount of extra work it places on developers, much of it the &quot;dumb&quot; kind of work which can eat up hours and doesn&#x27;t deliver all that much value.<p>i) It&#x27;s a framework, with all the usual framework downsides<p>For example, a new package you install can require a new TypesScript version. Once installed, you then may need to update your source code. This can place quite a high tax on the developer, where perhaps a 10 minute change becomes hours long.<p>ii) Libraries are badly documented<p>Most libraries do not document their types, or have no examples using TypeScript. Some worst offenders: Apollo, Protobufjs. The type definitions exported by these libraries can be large and complex, and the error messages emitted by TypeScript are so long and cryptic the result is often a drawn out process of trial and error along with trawling through source files.<p>iii) Error messages are hard to follow<p>Errors are long and don&#x27;t provide enough detail. They will explain a type mismatch referencing many types you may not have ever seen, and are not documented anywhere. Except for simple errors, many of them are very hard to follow to a remedy.<p>iv) It requires yet more transpilation<p>Transpilation takes time, and always adds a burden to developers. I didn&#x27;t mind so much with ES6 etc because eventually many functions were included in a broad set of browsers. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much progress including TypeScript in a browser, and feels like these complicated transpilation steps could be with us for a long time.<p>I could probably add more to this list, but my point is that I just can&#x27;t see that TypeScript is worth all this time investment and making progress so slow sometimes.

34359458,Show HN: Backprop – Smarter Pull Requests,2023-01-12T20:00:05Z,eagrwl,5,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey everyone!<p>Every reviewer loves smaller pull requests, but they can be hard to do practically.<p>We created a Github integration that adds the following features<p><pre><code>  - Commit checkpoints (i.e. stacked reviews)
  - Autogenerated tabs (based on dependency graphs)
  - A central pull request inbox (highlights which PRs need your attention)
</code></pre>
Commit checkpoints helps authors stack smaller changes within a single pull request without having to manage tons of branch offshoots. It works by using the common “[x&#x2F;n]” prefix notation (where x is the stack number). This is the workflow:<p><pre><code>  - Author makes some commits to a branch
  - Author is ready to set a review checkpoint, they leave a commit message prefixed with “[1&#x2F;n]”
  - Author continues to make commits, and when ready for the next review checkpoint, leaves a commit message prefixed with “[2&#x2F;n]”
  - etc
</code></pre>
Our UI collapses the in-between commits and makes it easy to see the diff between checkpoints. There’s also a feature to easily walkthrough them sequentially.<p>Lots of things are still WIP, looking for feedback to know what to prioritize next, thanks!",story,https://www.backprop.io,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
