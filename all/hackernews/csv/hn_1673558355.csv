Now we are in an argument because he refuses to see why it’s such a big deal and that it’s only text being shown (I think he is referring to the “XSS” which pops up).<p>No matter how much explaining I give, this Fiverr coder cannot accept that user injected JavaScript on our ADMIN ORDERS screen is a massive gaping security issue.<p>Am I being over-dramatic here?
