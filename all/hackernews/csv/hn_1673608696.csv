Their video ads are somewhat similar to the ones that sold online courses a while ago but now you hop on a “strategy” call.<p>Out of curiosity, I did, in a broad range of niches (probably the most popular ones are relationship advice, fitness, and make money online).<p>All of them, with no exception 
- delegated the strategy call to someone else, most of the time in other parts of the world
- had very good and clear language 
- tried hard to repeat certain keywords that I mentioned in describing my fictional situation 
- asked very specifically about how much money I have to “invest in myself”
- left me with a follow up call and asked to write down 3 questions to prepare for that call<p>All in all, they were really good in rapport building, and very interesting in terms of psychological tricks to close a deal.<p>But they were literally the same. Just different topics. It looks like they all aligned their strategy according to the same source.<p>I personally think that they are all trying to squeeze good money out of very desperate people. But this trend will stop when it becomes too crowded and people realize that it’s just the same with some psychological sugar coating. What’s your take on that?<p>I think some of the elements all of these coaches uses during their calls can be applied to serious sales conversations.
