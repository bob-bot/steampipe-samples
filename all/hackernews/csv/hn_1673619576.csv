I am a man with naturally curly hair, and as a result I usually have a bunch of hair on the top of my head that stands up like a crazy scientist. Sometimes it stands up in a way that only wetting it and drying it downwards with a towel gets it to go down.<p>I spend a lot of time pulling my hair sideways and downwards, in what my mind thinks is an attempt to flatten it down in a neater way. But sometimes I keep pulling even when it&#x27;s all looking okay, so clearly there is something else to it..<p>I&#x27;m conscious whenever I pull at my hair, as one or two do come out each time I do so. Thankfully I have quite good genetics and the hair outgrows my pulling, so no patches, but I realise that won&#x27;t last forever.<p>I&#x27;ve struggled for years to work out what the underlying cause of this is. I&#x27;m not particularly stressed, although it seems to be triggered whenever I do something that gets my brain working, or in times of stress (which is quite obvious). I&#x27;ve always been pointed to &quot;trichotillomania&quot;, but it can&#x27;t be this, as I don&#x27;t pull hairs out on purpose. It&#x27;s not on that level of severity.<p>Anybody else had something like this? 
And overcome it?<p>In the past I&#x27;ve overcome it, but it always comes back. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s an inherent way of me dealing with something, but I can&#x27;t work out what that is.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve also taken to biting my lips a lot, which could cause issues with my teeth and lips long term.<p>Could it just be a unique way of fidgeting?
