34368626,Show HN: I made Macaron – Type-safe CSS-in-JS with zero-runtime and colocation,2023-01-13T15:01:20Z,mokshit06,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN, my name is Mokshit and I&#x27;m really interested in web-performance and web-development. At the time of writing this, I&#x27;m a junior in high school.<p>Macaron is a typesafe CSS-in-JS library with zero runtime, colocation, maximum safety and productivity.<p>The motivation behind it is that runtime CSS-in-JS libraries, that is most of the CSS-in-JS libs, add alot of bloat to web apps and have a considerable performance drop with a bundle size increase. Alot of them also don&#x27;t support more performant ways of building web apps like streaming markup. Most of the current compile-time CSS-in-JS libraries try to fix this, but have some or the other drawback like not offering colocation, or not being type-safe.<p>Today, Macaron does all this with a compiler that extracts all the style declarations at compile-time and converts them to static css files while also letting you author the type-safe styles in the same file as your application code. It supports both - a vanilla styling API and a styled-component API with support for multiple frameworks like SolidJS and React and build tools like Vite and Esbuild. Macaron is currently missing a webpack plugin, but that will also be published soon, making it compatible with almost all bundlers.<p>There&#x27;s a ton of room for improvement in this space, and I feel like macaron is a step in that direction.<p>Github - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;macaron-css&#x2F;macaron"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;macaron-css&#x2F;macaron</a>",story,https://macaron.js.org,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
