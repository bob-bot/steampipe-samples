ith moves, divorce, spring cleaning and just plain stupidity I have a lot of cool stuff that I can’t turn on because that nice adapter that came with it is nowhere to be found.<p>In order to connect you need the right plug with the right polarity at the right volt and the right amp settings.<p>I do have drawers that are filled with Ac adapters that I have accumulated but seldom does one match a gadget I find.

Score.<p>Except.<p>How do I get that power into my gadgets?
There is no option for buying a bag of 1000 tips.<p>The wires it comes with do not look at all helpful.<p>What is the solution to the plague of missing ac adapters?
