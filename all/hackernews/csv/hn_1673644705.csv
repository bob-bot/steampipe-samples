I come across loads of research papers, books, articles, lecture notes, video lectures, audiobooks, podcasts, media , links and everything that interests me. I love to learn and most of the stuff I find are extremely interesting&#x2F;useful which I either have some use, an interest, or want to consume someday at least. I also write copious notes both digitally and on notebooks. I write blog posts but leave them half completed, only to start over again and use the earlier one to use as writing material for a fresh draft. What this has resulted in is unsurprisingly an overwhelming number of stuff to consume and work upon both in terms of work - interesting research papers in my field and excellent sources for everything that I am unable to delete, for i definitely know that I want to consume them someday, even if they aren’t a priority at the moment. So if I have a day off, there are just too many options and I waste all energy on analysis paralysis just to choose what to enjoy working on. Ideally I would want a system where I know everything is, like a file Wikipedia like system.<p>I have tried so many tools and left so many that it creates even more duplication. For example, having first tried notion, then shifting to obsidian then logseq etc that sometimes I forget what are in my vaults and rewriting notes from the source in a different app again.<p>Another example being calibre for e-books but the same books on the Apple Books app, my kindle and in my pdf cloud storage. Similarly  research papers within Zotero and in my PDF cloud storage.<p>Trying apps like hazel, notion, obsidian, DEVONthink, Zotero, raindrop, everything tool, sync thing. It doesn’t help that I have multiple devices- a windows laptop, an iPhone. This caused usage of multiple cloud systems iCloud,OneDrive, yandex(for Zotero WebDAV).<p>The first thing I did was just dump all of my files into a single folder and created just a few sub folders for the kind of file. Subfolders beyond a certain level was the worst pain for what I thought was an organising exercise.<p>What all this results in is that I have difficulty prioritising what to do, when to do it, find stuff and keep it sustainable.<p>I just need to structure a system like a reference for everything where I just know where everything is, and non redundant. Would love to hear some strategies and tips.
The reason I can’t continue with a single folder dump is that it limits discovery of what can I do and has high search effort.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Am I the only one worried by this?<p>For all the talk about &quot;AI ethics&quot; there is it seems strinking to me that the current state of the art model will opt for providing a convincing argument for why it&#x27;s wrong answer is correct, rather than say that the answer it provides might be innacurate. (Funnily enough this is what humans tend to do aswell.)
Being that these models often tend to be trained on data found on the internet, could this be a sign of the bias we tend to have when writing on social platforms and the internet in general? (As in justifying our answers instead of trying to get to the correct one)<p>So the questions are:
1. What are the consequences of this in the development of LLMs and in their application to various fields?<p>2. How would one implement this capability of recognizing where the model might be innacurate?<p>3. Is 2. really that much more complicated than what is currently being done?
