2. Does anybody have any experience hosting such a tournament? Any advice?

I have worked here quite a bit longer than them, longer than most people at the company, actually. I am probably &quot;employee #5&quot; in terms of tenure, and we have 30 or so employees right now.<p>I have a successful product at this company that has been bringing value, has been very stable, and works well. I am pretty much the only person who works on this product, but a few others contribute from time to time.<p>I want to stress that this project has been stable and only has had a few production bugs over the last year. It has processed quite a few requests, and I am responsive with issues and often can get features out to production the same day they are requested (while being tested, and with thoughtfulness - not just tossed out there - though there is always room for improvement).<p>Over the last year, the new team has demanded (not asked) that some major changes are to be made:<p>- We want to be a real microservices architecture, though I can&#x27;t get a completely clear answer as to what that is. They don&#x27;t think it needs separate databases, but they demand separate repos (no negotiation), separate deployments, and so on.<p>- They want major parts of the code that are in my repo to be split out into libraries that we may use in other parts of the company, but there are no concrete plans for their use. It is not &quot;wow, that works well - can we use it?&quot; it is &quot;make that a library, because we want it to be one&quot;<p>- They are changing my deployments. Right now I have CI&#x2F;CD which works really great. You merge, it gets deployed behind the scenes. Quick, painless, love it. They want to go through a QA, review, whole mess, which they can&#x27;t even explain to me (when I ask them to explain it, I am being difficult, even though I say, please, I just want to understand) fully. I am scared that this will make my job harder and I have mostly enjoyed my job until now and don&#x27;t want that to happen.<p>I was just recently told that I &quot;say no whenever we ask you for something&quot; which isn&#x27;t true. I realized that what was actually happening is some people made a decision without me, and when they thought they were telling me to do something, I was approaching it good faith as a discussion (not an order) and my &quot;wait, what about ... can we talk this through to ... &quot; was interpreted as a &quot;no.&quot;<p>The end of it is, I don&#x27;t see any added value to the changes, but I see a lot of problems, overhead, and stress to be added. When I ask about the value, it is seem as me being argumentative, difficult, and high maintenance.<p>What should I do? Have you been through something similar? What did you do?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
