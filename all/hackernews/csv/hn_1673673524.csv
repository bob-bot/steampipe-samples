34377504,Rate my note taking setup,2023-01-14T04:58:58Z,dhalwani,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Very simple. 
Private Github repo.
Write from anywhere using github.dev&#x2F;&lt;repo_path&gt;
Use mobile Github app and favorite repo for on the fly read access.
Use VScode to access every extension imaginable(e.g., millions of JSON extensions)
Downside: no easy on the fly editing access(could create this using some basic scripting but not out of the box)
Upside: Free, simple, get full git capabilities and using VScode can leverage VIM bindings...
