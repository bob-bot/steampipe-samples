34379640,Ask HN: Affordable online university for a 32 year old wanting to go back?,2023-01-14T12:09:24Z,tsingy,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hi, I&#x27;m 32 and after studying programming on and off for the past 3 months I realized I love this and feel excitement again in learning and building things. The problem? All the cool stuff are really technical (looking at you Chat GPT and Stable Diffusion), with lots of prerequisites that I do not have. So I decided after discussing with my fiancée that I will be going back to university to study either Computer Science or Mathematics (which I always wanted to be more knowledgeable about but never really had time to invest in). The goal is to get into machine learning before I turn 40. I&#x27;m now looking for an online university, hence the question. It would be really helpful and if anyone has attempted something like this please speak up and share your experience. I found The Open University (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.open.ac.uk&#x2F;) that seems good but want some reviews. Also it has to be online and in English so I can study from Madagascar to keep my COL as low as possible. Bonus point if it can be accelerated.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

In last 10 years non-of the CI&#x2F;CD vendors I know of created a platform where I can use a Dockerfile that references a public or private image that I can use to build my project.
