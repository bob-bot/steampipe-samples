34379830,Can you please give me advise on my early startup game plan?,2023-01-14T12:40:31Z,FaresAlgahtani,2,false,false,1,[34379954],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;m trying to start a company in the real estate tech space. Currently, I&#x27;m validating the problem, looking for the best customer-problem fit by being aware of its frequency and intensity. I&#x27;m using carrd.co to build quick prototypes to investigate the problem with potential customers. Up until now, life is good, and YC&#x27;s advise is working amazingly.<p>But I have two obstacles that are really weighing me down. The first is that my job at a bank is making it hard to talk to users, as I can&#x27;t talk to them after work or on weekends (they&#x27;re just not there). The second, is my lack of coding skills. I can build quick, good looking prototypes just fine on Carrd, but I know that I&#x27;m going to need a co founder to launch something that works and improve it on a bi-weekly basis. Plus, there&#x27;s a huge legal aspect with my idea, so do I need a third co-founder with a legal background? So here is my game plan to solve each, but I want your opinion, whoever you beautiful person are:<p>The Job:
I&#x27;m trying to secure fifteen minute talks with users during working hours to investigate the problem. That&#x27;s pretty doable. But, that&#x27;s not so useful when showcasing prototypes to see if whatever solution I have is actually helpful. I’m saving up money to go on an entrepreneurial break. But I need to save enough to afford a living for and my wife, and enough to pay off a loan I have. In the interim, I’m changing jobs to get a better salary and I’ll start using my annual leaves once a week to increase the time I can spend on my start-up. Whenever my leaves run out, I can just take unpaid ones. The problem here is that it’s going to take me more than a year (two more or less) to save enough money and payout the loan.<p>The skills:
I’m currently using website builders to make prototypes. But the options I’m working have some limitation. I am thinking about building a functional website as soon as I pinpoint the needs of my customers with the help of an IT development company, then outsource the work on iterations to freelancers. That&#x27;s the most cost effective way I can think about, but it will still cost me. I just don’t know how much. I firmly believe that finding a technical co-founder is the way to go, but I need to double down on searching for one in my circle. In terms of the legal expertise, it&#x27;s critical because the nature of our problem requires a solution with adequate agency cost mitigation. This might need big bucks to outsource.<p>Now the question is: what part of my plan is wrong, what is missing, and what is actually good?<p>Love to hear your guidance,<p>Thanks!!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
