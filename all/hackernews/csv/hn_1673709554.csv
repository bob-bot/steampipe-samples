I didn&#x27;t do it as well as I&#x27;d have liked to do, but that degree has gave me familiarity with most terms used in basic programming.<p>I spent last 3 months working on web development(I&#x27;m learning MERN). I learnt html,css,bootstrap, javascript and react till date(In bootcamp), but I failed to learn React. Even javascript, i&#x27;m no expert at. Even css, I learnt the basics but I&#x27;m not an expert when it comes to building half decent sites. Same for bootstrap. I can carve a site using html,css,bootstrap but it won&#x27;t look good. I was completely  impossible to learn when it came to react. Whenever I saw usage of useEffect and useState hooks and we start making changes in 10 different files for it, it confused me and I understood nothing.<p>I had access to world&#x27;s best resources to learn books, tutorials, blogs, youtube, udemy etc. I had access to forums like this to get help and support but still this was tough for me.<p>I feel unlucky, sad and hopeless atm. Friends who were weaker than me in conventional college studies and academia have done jobs and internships but I&#x27;m failing to even learn something properly. I&#x27;m not jealous of them but just feel trash about myself.<p>People say do projects to learn but I really don&#x27;t know how that works. For eg: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codepen.io&#x2F;pelko&#x2F;pen&#x2F;MWBpNmL This project. I make stupid stuffs like these and can&#x27;t produce a good output that is playable. It&#x27;s too hard for me.
These are some of my projects.

I nowadays try my best to add documentation though.<p>I&#x27;m 70% sure to give up programming but still I&quot;d like to make sure I follow advices from fellow forum users about it who&#x27;ve spent their life around programming.<p>In 3 months, I am seeing no progress, except few days like:<p>1) When I carved a site on my own using html,css without looking tutorials.<p>2) When I carved a site on my own using bootstrap without looking tutorials.<p>My problems:<p>1) I&#x27;ve not break through&#x27;ed in programming. If I can make anything with javascript that&#x27;s over 500 lines of code, I&#x27;d consider that a breakthrough. I&#x27;m aware LOC aren&#x27;t a good metric but please try to understand what I&#x27;m trying to say. A big application using programming.<p>2) Even in css, I failed to make presentable sites. The coding bootcamp I feel is going too fast as well. Same for bootstrap, I made sites but I failed ot create beautiful sites. People recommend me frontendmentor.io but IDK what to do there? It looks sketchy to me. If there is something that can teach me css, I&#x27;d be so grateful.<p>3) After watching tutorials, I can&#x27;t repeat what they&#x27;ve done in tutorial without watching the tutorial of project even though I understand each and every step they do in project.<p>4) I still am not fluent in ES6. I can&#x27;t think in ES6. Arrow functions, map, reduce etc. I Understand them, but using them is different ballgame.<p>If you understand my situation, please guide me. I don&#x27;t need roadmaps, any more tutorials but plain old guidance and advice on what to do by people who went through this situation",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
