After a few hard months of work building our platform, we were relieved to see customer feedback and turn our first profit. It was through a marketing campaign that had finally reached its target market after endless tuning and optimization. Prior to this point, we&#x27;re majorly negative net on product R&amp;D. It was a major win.<p>All payments were processed on our website through Stripe. I know. Major mistake to rely on one business to keep ours afloat. But our product neither violated Stripe policy nor did our account have any prior issues, so I just kept my fingers crossed and hoped for the best. Which all in all is not a great customer experience.<p>We fulfilled nearly all of our freshly incoming orders within 3 days of the transactions.<p>One day before our biggest payout hits, I&#x27;m awoken at 2:15 in the morning to an email from Stripe that sends me into sheer panic. Due to our company making &#x27;unauthorized&#x27; charges on our user&#x27;s cards, our account is both closed and Stripe is forcing a charge reversal for all transactions on our account.<p>We do not do this. Customers finalize checkout on a Stripe payment page, where they are shown amount, enter card details, and click a big fat button that says &quot;Pay now&quot;. I cannot envision any alternate universe where this kind of act is unauthorized.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m laying in bed at 2AM utterly crushed by the email, sure, but I then made the grave mistake of looking at my Stripe dashboard. We&#x27;re in the red. We have a negative Stripe balance just one day before the biggest payout our startup has ever seen. Not only do we owe Stripe money, we&#x27;re on the hook for COGS for every single transaction on our account.<p>Support wise, we&#x27;re at a dead end. There is no phone number. If you email the company, you&#x27;ll reach only robots pretending to be humans. Stripe has not replied to an email in 4 days. I get the exact same line from each contact attempt. &quot;This decision is final and in order to protect our processes, we are unable to provide further details regarding the reason for your account&#x27;s closure.&quot;<p>We&#x27;re utterly fucked. I&#x27;m behind on bills solely from Stripe&#x27;s negligence in account review. I never expect to hear from them again despite my consistent attempts, and I highly doubt a human being at Stripe has ever as much as looked at my account or read my emails in their entirety.<p>One question I have for the community: why is payment processing the most uptight industry on this planet? I cannot imagine one other business model that would require a company to treat their customers with such disrespect. There is zero compassion. There is zero regard for humanity. Why? All we&#x27;re doing here is processing an online payment.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
