In particular, I&#x27;m thinking about data. Is it common practice to inject fabricated data into a prod system to run such tests? What&#x27;s the best practice or prior art on doing this well?<p>Ultimately, I think this will end up looking like implementing SLIs and SLOs in PROD, but for some of my SLOs, I think I need to actually _fake_ the data in order to get the SLIs I need, so how to do this?<p>Suggestions appreciated -- thanks.<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;increment.com&#x2F;testing&#x2F;i-test-in-production&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;segment.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;we-test-in-production-you-should-too&#x2F;",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
