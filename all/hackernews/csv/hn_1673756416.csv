And you debug, one by one, and one by one. It goes down to 30, 29, 25, 24 .. and with a little patience you get it down to 4, 3, 2, and a error. Sometime you can even increase errors, because there is error around error, but it generally goes down just as quick.<p>Then you correct the last bug, and it then shows `Finished dev in ## seconds`. And, most probably, your code works just as you expected. No memory bugs, no side stuffs. Sure, there can be logical errors, and it can be corrected. But no hard to know errors. The error message tells you how to correct your syntax error. It&#x27;s a bit opinionated, but it&#x27;s good and, at the end of day, it guides you to write a decent code. And finally with `cargo fmt`, and your code looks just as compact and pretty as flawlessly it works.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
