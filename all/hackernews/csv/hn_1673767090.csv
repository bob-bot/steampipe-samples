They cannot shut down those servers.  They MUST hand over the information AWS demand.<p>I think companies more than anything want your phone number.  Phone numbers are the modern unique identifier; they rarely change and cost money to obtain.  Third party data collators collate based on phone number.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
