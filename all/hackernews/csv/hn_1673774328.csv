My ADHD makes it hard for me to keep up with conversation details if I don&#x27;t do this.<p>Even if company policy didn&#x27;t restrict a lot of useful software I&#x27;ve never found a workable software solution.<p>The ideal software would be something like Nvidia shadowplay where pressing a hotkey saves the last N minutes of video and sound.<p>I&#x27;ve tried using a capture card to stream to my own PC and then record from there which is an okay solution. The drawback is that I then need to deal with the maintenance of another device.<p>Surprisingly the best solution I&#x27;ve found so far is to use a small home security camera on my desk just out of sight from the Webcam. I can view tbe recordings from an app. The drawback here is that the text on the montior is barely readable, the sound sucks and I need to be mindful of where I put it.<p>There must be a better way?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
