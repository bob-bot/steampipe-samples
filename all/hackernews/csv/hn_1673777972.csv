I&#x27;m evaluating an offer from a brand new startup (raised a decent pre-seed round and have runway for 2-3 years) that will be joining a YC batch.<p>I&#x27;m already working in a similar startup; just without the YC part. So learning on the job is going to be similar in my current role and the one that I&#x27;m evaluating. The teams at both places are also similarly great.<p>Would I; as a founding engineer, gain the ability to learn a lot about building and scaling startups by being part of a team that&#x27;s going through a YC program?<p>I understand that YC is mostly for the founders, so I&#x27;m not sure if as an engineer I stand to learn and grow from this.<p>Does anyone who&#x27;s worked as an employee at a early stage startup that went through YC have any thoughts on how the experience was for them? Were you able to learn and grow more because your startup was part of YC?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

None used the reinforcement learning techniques used by DeepMind few years ago to learn board games.<p>DeepMind recently used the same technique to improve the efficiency of matrix multiplication algorithms.  Yet if I understand correctly, it didn&#x27;t use a language model.<p>A mathematical expression is a sequence of symbols of finite, yet arbitrary length.  As such, it needs an attention mechanism to be processed by a neural network, just like with sentences in natural or programming languages.<p>One task one might assign to a Computer Algebra System would be to simplify an algebraic expression, that is to translate it into a shorter one, or rather to a &quot;simpler&quot; one, provided one can assign a useful complexity measure on the input domain.<p>Is there any work done on this?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
