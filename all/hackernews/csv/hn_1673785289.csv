Methods from Atomic Habits by James Clear—is what worked best for me, but it was still difficult. For example, I had a daily push-up reminder on my google calendar that I ignored for almost a year.<p>Fast forward, I’m now on day 120+ doing push-ups, meditation and waking up before 6am—after participating in group accountability challenges :)<p>To see if we can scale it to help more people and potentially build a community-driven business—we just released an iOS app. Recap of how it works:<p>- Join 10-30 day accountability challenges in small groups of 3-12 people.
- Commit a daily goal and check-in with the group on whether you didn’t or didn’t do it
- Daily visual progress reports, reward credits&#x2F;penalties and support from others helps everyone stay on track
-  Create and join private challenges with friends<p>Would love to have you try it by joining a challenge—and see if could help you become the person you want be for 2023!",story,https://www.joinsquad.co,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
