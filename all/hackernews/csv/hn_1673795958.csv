Right now, I find it really difficult to keep up with all the important new publications in our field. Especially, it is sometimes difficult to get an overview of a paper to decide if it&#x27;s worth reading. I really like arxiv-sanity by Andrej Karpathy, but even with that, it can still take some time to understand the main ideas and contributions from the abstract. With arxiv-summary, my goal is to make ML research papers more &quot;human-parsable&quot;.<p>The website works by fetching new papers daily from arxiv.org, using PapersWithCode to filter out the most relevant ones. Then, I parse the papers&#x27; pdf and LaTeX source code to extract relevant sections and subsections. GPT-3 then summarizes each section and subsection as bullet points, which are finally compiled into a blog post and uploaded to the site.<p>You can check out the site at arxiv-summary.com and see for yourself. There&#x27;s also a search page and an archive page where you can get a chronological overview. If you have any feedback or questions, I&#x27;d be happy to hear them. Also, if you work at OpenAI and could gift me some more tokens, that would be much appreciated :D<p>Thanks and happy reading!",story,https://www.arxiv-summary.com/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
