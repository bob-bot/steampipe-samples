I used to be a Country Club Tennis Coach, we used expensive club management software similar to Unwynd to organize club events, and it was a lifesaver. Unwynd is basically the personal version of a club management system.<p>Fun fact: For 10 years, I helped hundreds of people bond through tennis, and saw the power of bonding over shared activities firsthand. I even met my wife on the court! Now I want to extend that to a bunch of other activities and to millions of people!<p>Check it out, share your feedback (the good, the bad and the ugly), and help spread the word by sharing it with friends &#x2F; family who you wanna hang out with more (or who you think might benefit from Unwynd).<p>How you can have fun using Unwynd:<p>Plan Parties: Save time and energy planning medium to large size parties. Don’t open the can of worms by texting. Any details you want to share are easily visible. Invites to new users are sent via sms or a shared link and Unwynd users get push notification that pulls them straight to the activity to rsvp.<p>Weekly Events are Easy: Super useful for any size event if it happens regularly. You can do one invite one time for dozens of activities. Each upcoming activity will automatically send out invites and get your RSVP list every week. Perfect for weekly meetings, team practices, and fun get-togethers. For me it is hitting the golf simulator on Wednesdays or playing tennis on Thursdays.<p>Public Activities: You can also share activities publicly (we haven&#x27;t added distance filtering so activities can be from anywhere). I can’t wait until I can go on vacation and make a post for beach volleyball and then go hit it with locals. You can switch from private to public anytime, so if you can&#x27;t get enough friends to play you can fill your group with locals.<p>Thank you for checking out Unwynd, I cannot wait to hear your thoughts!<p>Mitchell Reynolds

Think along the lines of the NYT, WP, et al., but not one of those big mainstream newspapers.<p>What I really liked was the design of the page.
