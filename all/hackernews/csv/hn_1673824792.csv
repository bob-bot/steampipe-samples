It can predict how much caffeine you&#x27;ll have at bedtime and tell you what time your caffeine will be below a configurable sleepable level.<p>I also added a feature that gives you a notification 30 minutes before you can have your last cup of coffee and still be under your bedtime target at bedtime. This helps you stay maximally caffeinated while minimizing the negative effects.<p>I have over 600 drinks in my drinks list, and I&#x27;d appreciate any feature suggestions or tangential app ideas as well.",story,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/caff-ai-manage-your-caffeine/id1611999311,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
