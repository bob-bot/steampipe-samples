My main worry is I feel like I don’t have anything to offer and &#x27;pick your brain&#x27; always feels one-sided.
Ryan Hoover: As a fellow introvert, I can empathize. :)<p>You&#x27;re right that the cold &quot;may I pick your brain&quot; ask isn&#x27;t very effective in meeting people or building relationships. Instead I would try to be helpful and get involved in communities that are aligned with your interests. More on...<p>Being helpful: This can be in the form of proactive 1:1 outreach or broader content&#x2F;community creation (start a newsletter, podcast, meetups, etc.). The key is to be consistent and stick with it. I used to blog almost daily for years and published hundreds of essays before starting Product Hunt. Doing so helped build a small but relevant audience, and some of those connections led to lasting relationships.<p>Community participation: Putting yourself out there creates serendipity. You can do this online and IRL, but the key is to be authentic and avoid transactional conversations.<p>If you ever feel anxious, know that many others likely have similar feelings and try to embrace the confidence to get out there.

Today, I am excited to share with you my journey and experience in launching my first SaaS product. As a full-stack software developer with over 8 years of experience, I have always been passionate about building SaaS products. However, in the past, I often found myself getting sidetracked by excuses or procrastinating on development.<p>But last year, I made a commitment to myself to create a clear strategy that would help bring my ideas to life. I realized that having a solid plan in place was key, and it has truly made a difference in my progress.<p>I am thrilled to announce that I am now in the final stages of launching Pivotlar, a beta version of my new SaaS that simplifies the process of hosting WordPress websites on your own VPS. Pivotlar allows you to provision a VPS with your chosen server provider, and then takes care of installing all the necessary tools for a WordPress site to function properly. Once the server is provisioned, you can easily add your website by simply providing your domain name, and Pivotlar will handle the rest - from installing WordPress to adding themes and plugins.<p>The website for Pivotlar is now live at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pivotlar.com, and I would appreciate any feedback on the product idea and landing page. If you think Pivotlar could be beneficial to you, please sign up for our waiting list.<p>Thank you for your support and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
