I know this will never get through this websites shitty spam filter design.<p>TLDR, been stalked everywhere I go by US funded terrorists (what I call US Stasis). Also known as cops and sheriffs.<p>It began 3 years ago when one night I randomly looked out of my home&#x27;s window. Some new neighbors porch lights suddenly turned on and off. It kept happening any time I would peek and mind you my curtains were completely closed.<p>After this day I began noticing an absurd amount of pig.. cops wherever I would go.<p>These terrorists also began showing up to my place of work. Acting as regular customers but clearly using Stasi gaslighting tactics. Why? I have no clue.<p>They&#x27;ve also had cops live next to the apartment room of one of my family members. One day I randomly took a photo of their cop car in the parking lot and they disappeared from this location.<p>I can go on and on with the list but I&#x27;ll wrap it up.<p>This government is completely corrupt and worse than Hitler&#x27;s government. Prove me wrong.<p>Lastly I recently woke up with pain in my entire body and it has since subsided but this tells me these terrorists have damaged my DNA with their ionizing weapons.<p>I know they are using some form of X-ray weapon to see inside where I live. No I&#x27;m not a nut job. In fact I spend my free time reading about physics&#x2F;quantum mechanics. I enjoy hearing Bach and Beethoven.<p>The original Stasis would use X-rays to induce cancer into their victims. I believe the same is true in my case as these terrorists are afraid of my speaking out against them.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
