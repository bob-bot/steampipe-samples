I am investigating moving some of this data into an event-stream as a path forward to reduce pressure on the DB and facilitate scaling APIs.<p>The high-level architecture:<p><pre><code>  - DB change detection publishes events to an immutable event stream.
  - Event-stream processing service projects the data from the event-stream into a database for particular API.
  - Data served from the API is sourced from the projected data in the API database.

The trade offs with this architecture are:<p><pre><code>  - Eventual consistency
  - Copies of data
  - Managing complexity
  - Schema changes
