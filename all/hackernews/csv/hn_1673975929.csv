34414851,Ask HN: What do you think about Peter Zeihan's Geopolitical Analysis?,2023-01-17T16:49:07Z,drKarl,4,false,false,1,[34415045],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve been watching some videos and Keynotes delivered by Peter Zeihan, I may read his last book, but I would like to know HN&#x27;s opinion of analysis. All his explanations really make sense but his claims sound hyperbolic. Let me try to recap some of the things he says (I&#x27;ll probably forget many things):<p>- Most of the developed world save notable exceptions like the USA (in USA the Boomers are retiring but the Millenials will take over) is aging at an accelerated pace as a result of the decrease on the birth rates. In Europe, Germany which is currently like the 3rd or 4th economy worldwide, will cease to be so powerful because of their demographics alone. In addition to that, much Germany&#x27;s industry was based on cheap gas from Russia which is no longer an option, and raw materials from Russia and China which also will no longer be an option.<p>- China&#x27;s demographics are even worse, as a result of their one child policy, and their population is aging at a much faster pace. Average birthrate are like 0.8 and theres many more men than women which means that in 10 years there will no be China as we know it anymore. Add to that the results of Zero Covid policy which destroyed their economy, and now since they don&#x27;t have herd immunity a full blown covid meltdown, the Evergrande meltdown (which I didn&#x27;t hear him mention, that&#x27;s my own addition) and some other factors and things don&#x27;t look good for China.<p>- 90% of rare earth materials come from China and Russia, mostly China, and most of the manufacturing comes from China and Germany, so that would mean the age of abundance where we have everything, is gone (or will be soon).<p>- Russia&#x27;s population is also aging dramatically, and since Russia is basically and basically impossible to defend, that&#x27;s the main reason why Putin invaded Ukraine, but then he would have to invade Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Georgia, Azerbajan, Uzbekhistan, and a long list of other countries to feel secure. And they had to do it now because in a few years they won&#x27;t have the amount of 20 year olds to wage a war.<p>- Russia is the main exporter of fertilizer and potash worlwide, so this year and into next year there will be famine in many parts of the world because there will not be enough fertilizer for everyone.The USA will be fine because it produces most of the inputs to grow food. China will not be fine because it imports most of the imports to grow food.<p>- 80% of neon production is gone since the first phase is done in Russia and the second phase is done in Ukraine. Neon is used for lasers in semiconductor industry. The other 20% comes from China...<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing lots of points to connect, but I think there&#x27;s enough for now. What do you think of all of this? Do you have any other insights about the world to make?<p>- Russia&#x27;s ships can&#x27;t get insurance, so they can&#x27;t transport oil and other exports. Russia kind of provides state insurance and so ships with oil go to Portugal where then China moves them to some rented supertankers and go the long route bordering the continent to China, but those supertankers are very vulnerable to pirates or any rogue state just taking them by force. Also there&#x27;s not storage capacity so if the ships start queing it blocks the flow. Production cannot be stopped, specially since in cold weather if it stops moving oil converts into a gel and breaks all the machinery which took 30 years to reproduce last time that happened. So if we take 4 million barrels a day out, we can get to 180 dollars a barrel.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

While our tool is mostly geared toward pentesters and bug bounty hunters, we thought some of you might find it useful.<p>The web security auditing toolkit space hasn&#x27;t seen much innovation in recent years, with current tools feeling outdated and lacking in performance and user experience. As the number of security professionals continues to increase, there is a growing need for a user-friendly alternative. This is what motivated us to create Caido.<p>At its core, Caido is a proxy that sits in between you and your target. It allows you to record &amp; filter traffic, tamper with requests, replay them to test exploits, brute force parameters, etc.<p>As we started building, we wanted to focus on the following two points:<p>- Performance: In our space, the most-used proxies rely on Java and consume large amounts of memory. It is not uncommon to hear hackers saying they built a PC with 32GB+ of RAM especially to run a proxy. To address this issue, we developed Caido using Rust and optimized it to take advantage of SSDs as opposed to keeping everything in-memory. It&#x27;s been working great so far, giving us a good balance of low-level control, reasonable memory usage and speed.<p>- Flexibility: Instead of a monolithic desktop application, we decided to split the user interface from the proxy component. This allows Caido to be deployed anywhere from a laptop to a cheap VPS. Businesses will be able self-host their Caido instances and grant access to external pentesters&#x2F;bug bounty hunters as needed. This approach also allows users to have more oversight over their data.<p>Caido is currently not open source, but we&#x27;re considering an open-core model. We still want to be transparent in our development, so we have an open roadmap [1]. We will also be focusing on a plugin system this year.<p>We are a small bootstrap team of 3 people at the moment. While Caido is available for free, you can subscribe to a Pro plan to support the project. We plan on introducing exclusive features for Pro users throughout the year such as instance sharing, synced workspaces, etc.<p>We have been in private beta for around a year now and we feel we have built something worth sharing with the community. You can join our Discord [2], follow us on Twitter [3] or watch our Github [4] to get updates.<p>Let us know what you think and I’m happy to answer questions!<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caido.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caido.io</a>

34414847,Ask HN: Is there a resource for implications of nomadic remote work?,2023-01-17T16:48:49Z,infetc,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"My company is looking into how nomadic remote work (domestically in the US and abroad) can affect tax obligations, contract enforcement, employment laws, etc.<p>Is there a good resource for what types of work and for what duration might trigger any sorts of obligations for the company? Some states do not have clear guidelines for employment taxes, and looking at other countries is an even more mixed bag. It doesn&#x27;t have to be exhaustive, but even pointers to each state&#x27;s or country&#x27;s resources (if available) would be useful.<p>Example scenarios that I&#x27;d like to have information on:<p>1. An employee in Colorado is visiting family in Pennsylvania for the holidays. The employee is flying out a week early and plans to work remotely for five days. The company is headquartered in California and has no other employees or offices in Pennsylvania.<p>2. The company is holding sales kickoff in Tennessee for five days. An employee in Maine wants to get out of winter early and spend a month renting a house in Tennessee around the offsite, staying a few weeks before and a week after. The company is willing to cover the cost of the rental during the week of the offsite, but the employee is paying the rest of the cost.<p>3. An employee in Utah likes to work around ski season. They want to spend as much time as they can in Chile over the southern hemisphere winter. Outside of employee visa issues, what should the company be aware of in the cases of contracts or other matters?<p>A lot of this often gets glossed over in smaller companies (and sometimes larger ones), and maybe that&#x27;s the right way to look at it. I only know of one other company that keeps a red&#x2F;yellow&#x2F;green list of places to work nomadicly, and that&#x27;s due to the nature of their deals, contract sizes, and traveling workforce.<p>Other than having an employment lawyer look into each detailed scenario, can I answer basic questions around duration of nomadic remote work that warrants further investigation?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
