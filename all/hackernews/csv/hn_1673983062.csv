- Copy all the pictures and videos to the HDD.
- Scan the HDD with Digikam, detecting new elements.
- Move the pictures videos on their espective folders, which is usually just a `YYYY &gt; MM` structure.
- Once everything has been imported and sorted, plug the other HDD and create a borg archive with the current timestamp.<p>It works fairly good for me so far, but I want to improve the &quot;scan with Digikam and sort files&quot; thing, it&#x27;s by far the slowest part; I&#x27;ve also tried different options like gThumb and ShotWell but neither seem to have an easy way to &quot;get all the files in this directory and move them to their right directory based on the datetime the picture was taken&quot;.<p>Thank you.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

We have created programming languages to be able to give instructions to a computer in a way that human beings can use these. Now we are learning computers this human language so it can propose coding.
However if we make computers understand our normal language (we did that), wouldn&#x27;t it be much more efficient if we let this computer create computer language directly? It will be much more efficient for the AI, it will enable much greater options since we are not restricted by the programming language, and it will have much less overhead.
