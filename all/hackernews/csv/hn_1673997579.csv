We spoke to mentors on our platform (we run a mentorship platform) and here&#x27;s what they had to say about why you&#x27;re not getting promoted even though you have years in the job or have taken more responsibilities.<p>Promotions are not based on tenure - Just because you have 10 years on a job does not mean you should be promoted. Promotions depends on your contributions. Coworkers with 1-2 years on the job might be getting promoted. If you are not getting promoted, speak to your manager about why. Don&#x27;t be afraid to have a honest conversation with him.<p>Take credit for your work  - You&#x27;re not taking credit for your work. If someone compliments your work, take it! Don&#x27;t make your contributions seem small. Make sure your boss knows how important your contributions are.<p>Bosses don&#x27;t read minds - Some people don&#x27;t want to get promoted because it might be too much work. If you want to get promoted, let your boss know. He can&#x27;t read your mind!<p>You need to demonstrate leadership skills - Getting promoted means overseeing and managing others. You will need effective leadership skills. You should try to gain these leadership skills to get promoted.<p>Analyzing past performance reviews  - Just because they give you positive performance reviews does not mean you will get promoted. If you are getting good reviews and still not getting promoted, speak to your boss about why.<p>Responding to feedback - Make sure you are open to constructive criticism and not getting defensive when someone gives you feedback. You don&#x27;t want to seem like you&#x27;e difficult to work with. Being receptive to criticism is important for growth.<p>Staying in your comfort zone - You&#x27;re not challenging yourself. Maybe you&#x27;re doing enough for your role. You need to take on more challenges and go above and beyond to get promoted. Show your boss that you&#x27;re indispensable.<p>Do you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them below?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
