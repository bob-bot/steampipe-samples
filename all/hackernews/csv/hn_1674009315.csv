34422478,How do I get back into programming?,2023-01-18T01:58:01Z,finghin,1,false,false,2,[34422595],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;m 22, currently taking a gap year from university. Next year I&#x27;ll graduate from a fairly renowned European university with a good degree in an arts subject with a minor in maths, and at this rate with good grades - so I&#x27;ll get a &quot;good degree&quot;.<p>My dad is a programmer, and he encouraged me to learn basic coding: I grew up surrounded by computers, playing video games - long story short, I spent a lot of time in my teen years messing around with computers, Linux, designing websites, learning to code in JS, Python, C++. I guess the most advanced project I ever completed was an aim-bot for Counter-Strike.<p>I thought I knew what I wanted to do entering university - pursuing an academic path - and I just didn&#x27;t have time to program as a hobby anymore. Then in college I worked part-time in an unrelated field and I&#x27;ve taken a gap year to explore working in that field. I&#x27;m leaning away from that now, and I guess I&#x27;m reverting back to something I was once passionate about and could honestly see myself doing for eight hours a day at work.<p>Not having touched programming at all besides basic personal website-making since I was about seventeen, and at the time never being invested in any particular technology for job-seeking reasons anyway, I find learning programming all over again intimidating. But I know I&#x27;m intelligent enough to do it, I _enjoy_ it - I just don&#x27;t really know where to start, or if I can genuinely self-teach myself to the point of getting hired without some kind of software diploma.<p>My areas of interests are fairly niche&#x2F;disparate - I really enjoyed the low-level programming in the video-game hacking stuff, and I love the idea of (audio) DSP engineering. But I don&#x27;t know if there are many junior roles available in those fields. I also love design _tout court_, and web and app design seems like a nice way to get into that space, but it seems like such an enormous task to learn all the different frameworks, and knowing which ones are most up-to-date and trendy in the job market.<p>I guess I&#x27;m asking how should I approach getting a job as a junior developer, as a graduate from a non-coding degree, with a year or so to get back into this kind of stuff? What are the technologies to get into for safe junior dev jobs? Should I just make some kind of portfolio?<p>Thank you guys!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
