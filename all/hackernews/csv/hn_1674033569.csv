The pay, without being out of line with the market, is more than I ever thought I&#x27;d make. I owned my house outright at age 40, I go out to eat whenever I feel like it, I get to travel a few times a year. I&#x27;m pretty happy about my life day to day.<p>But then I still think of my job as challenging and sometimes stressful. I look at some of my lower level engineering peers that are &quot;stuck&quot; in their careers (5+ years at the same level, no management responsibility), and honestly I feel like they have a pretty blissful life. Maybe I&#x27;m idealizing, but I feel like they can just think about how to build something, get it built, and move to the next thing. Not have to deal with recruitment, management, strategy, etc. Show up and fix the bugs.<p>I used to be a SWE and have kept my skills current, so I&#x27;m considering a move back and down from senior strategy and product work back to engineering IC work. This would likely cut my pay in half, so I&#x27;d have to do away with some luxuries, but I feel I could manage it financially.<p>Yet I also have a strong instinct against doing this, because it feels like self sabotage according to the standard definitions of a career. I worry about having regrets and endangering my family&#x27;s financial safety.<p>Any folks who&#x27;ve gone through this and want to share their advice?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It defines a simple but powerful syntax for describing code modifications, combining plain text, regular expressions and Tree-sitter queries, along with sensible handling of newlines and indentation*.<p>It can be used just like regular plain text find &amp; replace, but allows freely mixing in regexes and Tree-sitter queries as more flexibility is needed.<p>It introduces &quot;line quantifiers&quot; for matching a bunch of lines at the same nesting level, so basic structural changes can be achieved without even using a query (see the JavaScript function example in the link).<p>I designed Codex with a specific use-case in mind (the one I show in the video), so any suggestions for other things it should support would be much appreciated, as well as general feedback.<p>*Indentation is relative and space&#x2F;tab agnostic.",story,https://codex-kappa-dusky.vercel.app/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
34424626,Could a Computer Take Over? Robert Silverberg,2023-01-18T08:30:23Z,daly,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"This discussion is not new. Quoting from Byte Magazine (Feb 1976 p77):<p>The first man to use a machine was the first of our primitive ancestors who picked up a rock to hurl at some passing animal or to crack open some edible nut. In the million-plus years since then, our machines have grown much more complex, but even in our modern era of computers, ... their basic purpose remains the same: to serve man.<p>Whether our machines truly serve us is a question much debated by science-fiction writers and other professional speculative philosophers. Does some essential quality go out of human life when it becomes too easy? Have our automobiles, telephones, typewriters and elevators sapped our vigor? Are we speeding into flabby decay because we have made things too easy for ourselves?<p>And as our machines grow more able, when do they cross the boundary that separates the living from the unliving? Is it possible that we are building machines that will make humanity obsolete? Perhaps the day is coming when we ourselves will be rendered unnecessary, and our sleek successors, creatures of metal and plastic, will inherit the earth.<p>... Many a bitter attack on the encroachments of the machine age has been produced by a writer using an electric typewriter in an air-conditioned room, innocently unaware of the inner contradictions involved. We need our machines, but we fear them...<p>-- Robert Silverberg, Introduction to Men and Machines.<p>In contrast I&#x27;d comment that this is a case of linear thinking. You don&#x27;t own a machine, the machine owns you. Ask any home owner how wonderful the plumbing works... until it doesn&#x27;t. Or ask a car owner, etc. We are already owned by machines. Is your phone beeping? Are you ignoring it? If it fails do you learn to live without a phone? Machines inherited the earth years ago.
