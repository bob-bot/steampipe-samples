Excited to share what we’ve been working on for the past few months. Monoid is a self-hosted, open-source first platform for automating data privacy requirements.<p>At Monoid’s core are open-source privacy connectors with DB’s, warehouses, SaaS tools, and more. These connectors let organizations automate user data export&#x2F;deletion (for DSARs) and scan for&#x2F;map PII.<p>We think that going open-source improves on the privacy software category meaningfully:<p>- Monoid is extensible by design, so if there are missing integrations for needed data silos, it’s straightforward to add custom connectors 
- Monoid is locally deployable and thus <i>truly</i> private.<p>You can play around with a read-only demo account at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.monoid.co"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.monoid.co</a>, and sign up for our cloud offering at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.monoid.co"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.monoid.co</a>.<p>We’re adding code-scanning, consent management, and more in the coming weeks.
