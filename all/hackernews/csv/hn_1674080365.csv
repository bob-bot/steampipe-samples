If fact, I developed it, and I put a lot of thought and mental resources into implementing everything with a sturdy plan in mind. I invested no more than two months into it – and I did not ask for any payment. I am proud of how it finally went; the theory behind the system, the system itself, and the front-end design – all very well-built. Also cheap to maintain and operate.<p>The product utilizes AI technology to create short-format mobile video content aka &quot;clips&quot; out of lengthy widescreen content. Inside, it has a simple onboarding funnel and media-processing tooling to turn any videos into shorts&#x2F;tiktoks&#x2F;reels with some extra AI assistance. It is ready to be presented to anyone interested at an URL. It can embark on getting into its niche, but here is the thing...<p>At the last moment, everything started to go wrong with communication inside the company of the people with whom we founded this project. The trust was lost in a matter of dozen slack messages, and one of us, who was actually in charge of setting up the business entity and company processes just left the boat.<p>So, me and another UI&#x2F;UX partner are left together. And we have our awesome system in place, but we have no CEO or domain or business entity anymore (maybe it&#x27;ll hold another day or two).
We are greatly motivated to take this further, despite a lack of skills to grow a startup from scratch, but it is kinda confusing now. I have some savings to make it for another 2-3 months and an awesome piece of web software which costs about half of my rent to run for month. I feel like we should pursuit selling it behind our own brand, migrating the infrastructure and getting a new domain is a matter of few days, but I also really want to hear other opinions and perspectives on the situation.<p>What do we do?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

While CapacitorJS was initially seen as an alternative to Cordova, with its emphasis on simplicity and ease of use, it has now been absorbed into the corporate ecosystem and risks losing its independence and its original purpose.<p>Moreover, the merger has led to the Cordova community being reinvigorated by the influx of new ideas, perspectives, and resources, but at the expense of CapacitorJS&#x27;s own community. CapacitorJS, once an independent entity, now risks being overshadowed by the Cordova framework and its community, causing the loss of its own identity and community.<p>Furthermore, this merger can also be seen as a way for the corporation to capitalize on the popularity of CapacitorJS and use it for their own gain. The merger has led to an increase in the number of contributions to the Cordova project and has created a more active and growing community, but at the cost of CapacitorJS&#x27;s own community.<p>In short, the merger of CapacitorJS with a major corporation has brought renewed attention to the Apache Cordova framework, but at the expense of CapacitorJS&#x27;s independence, identity, and community. The Cordova framework, once again, becomes the dominant player in the cross-platform mobile development and CapacitorJS is just a footnote in the history.
