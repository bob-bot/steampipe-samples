Contributors can post messages on the board to celebrate a co-worker, friend or a family member.<p>I built Bravoboard to scratch my own itch. My friends and colleagues use a competitor (anonymized intentionally) and while it&#x27;s a great tool, the pricing is steep and the free tier is barely usable at just a few posts per board. The most basic version requires you to pay a decent amount, yet, there are multiple basic features behind a paywall. Judging by how often my friends use the platform and are forced to upgrade each time, I decided to spin up a platform that would enable them to have a cap-free experience at a fraction of the cost.<p>Bravoboard has all the core features. Creators have full control over the board and can moderate any post on their boards. Bravoboards can be scheduled for delivery at a later date and reminders can be set for users to be reminded of upcoming events. Gifs are powered by GIPHY. A single Bravoboard with unlimited posts and unlimited users costs less than $1.
