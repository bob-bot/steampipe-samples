34435023,Tell HN: Some analytics from an old Show HN about literature,2023-01-19T00:14:17Z,pipnonsense,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey HN!<p>On August 2020 I posted a fairly successful Show HN[0]for a service[1] that I had just built: <i>&quot;Serial Literature - Literature in weekly installments delivered to your email inbox&quot;</i>.<p>Just last week I got a nice email of appreciation by a subscriber, which prompted me into look how it is doing. Something that I hadn&#x27;t checked for more than an year, I think. So I decided to share, just out of curiosity, same data about its traction.<p>A relevant info is that I only promoted the service on the mentioned Show HN and, I think, on Reddit around that time, without much traction there though. Then I did a few updates adding more books. Then... I just left it there, working. Without worrying about maintaining it or marketing it. Which shows in the data below.<p>Another note for the HN crowd, the tech stack is a static site built with Eleventy, hosted on Netlify; using its Lambda Functions to save the data on FaunaDB serverlessly; then an AWS lambda function with a cron job to schedule the email delivery every night, using Mailgun. All of it on these services&#x27; free tier plan (so I could set and forget).<p>So, some limited analytics data (since I dind&#x27;t set up any tracking).<p><i>Revenue</i> : $0 (I never charged or intended too, I did built another site, kind of similar, but for new writers, with more for-profit goals[2])<p><i>Total subscribers</i> : 1012 (the last one just yesterday, more than two years after any promotion).<p><i>Active subscribers</i> : IDK (the query is a bit tricky, so I am just guessing from email delivery data, I think between 100 and 200 as of last December).<p><i>Emails sent by month since launch</i> :<p>(emails can be sent from 1 to 7 times a week for each book a subscriber is currently reading)<p><i>2020 September</i> ..... 4675<p><i>2020 October</i> ....... 8021<p><i>2020 November</i> ...... 5664<p><i>2020 December</i> ...... 4660<p><i>2021 January</i> ....... 3884<p><i>2021 February</i> ...... 2809<p><i>2021 March</i> ......... 2430<p><i>2021 April</i> ......... 2145<p><i>2021 May</i> ........... 1927<p><i>2021 June</i> .......... 1441<p><i>2021 July</i> .......... 1374<p><i>2021 August</i> ........ 1191<p><i>2021 September</i> ..... 1054<p><i>2021 October</i> ....... 1156<p><i>2021 November</i> ......  801<p><i>2021 December</i> ......  751<p><i>2022 January</i> ....... 1024<p><i>2022 February</i> ......  781<p><i>2022 March</i> .........  770<p><i>2022 April</i> .........  827<p><i>2022 May</i> ...........  870<p><i>2022 June</i> ..........  755<p><i>2022 July</i> ..........  795<p><i>2022 August</i> ........  721<p><i>2022 September</i> .....  660<p><i>2022 October</i> .......  723<p><i>2022 November</i> ......  740<p><i>2022 December</i> ......  564<p>Emails delivery metrics: 98.59% delivered, 0.45% suppressed, 0.96% dropped (I don&#x27;t track opening rate)<p>[0] Show HN link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24307752<p>[1] Site link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.serialliterature.com&#x2F;<p>[2] My for-profit, kind of similar site, but focusing on new writers wanting to publish original fiction: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.confabulists.com",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
