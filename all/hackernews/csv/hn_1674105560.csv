There&#x27;s so much information and tips out there that I&#x27;m getting a bit overwhelmed.<p>My idea: An entryway mirror that has a display and a UV camera built in. It is an ordinary mirror when the display is switched off, but before leaving the house, the user is able to see their sunscreen coverage on the face &amp; neck via the UV camera.<p>This is what sunscreen looks like on the face in UV: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.melanomaprevention.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;uv2.jpg<p>Where I&#x27;m lost:<p>I am not a social media person, a lot of websites like indiehackers focus on having a following starting a blog etc. to market your idea.<p>Am I to build an MVP now and share it online (where?) and see if people want it? Or do I CAD it up, create renders, and test to see if there&#x27;s interest online (how and where?)<p>After developing an MVP and validating its market potential, am I just placing it on kickstarter?<p>I&#x27;m based in Melbourne, Australia and have always been an idea&#x27;s and building person, but I tend to get lost in the details when it comes to implementing it in a business sense. Where can I find a mentor that&#x27;s willing to help?
For example, I&#x27;m thinking about shipping, how do I successfully ship a sheet of glass worldwide with my current resources. I get that the shipping thing is also part of the problem, and there are many ways to solve it, ie. by changing the product dimensions, investing in shipping, etc.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
