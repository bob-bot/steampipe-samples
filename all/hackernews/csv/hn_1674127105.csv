Just recently, my manager told me I fail to see the big picture.<p>School was easier: the path is laid out for us and we just need to, more or less, follow it. At work, not so much. Everything is ill defined and you&#x27;re sort of expected to &quot;learn by osmosis&quot; (by going to meetings, listening to your team chatting and then forming an understanding). I&#x27;m terrible at this and the consequence is that I don&#x27;t always prioritise my effort and work well.<p>The obvious answer is to ask, but I&#x27;m not always aware of what I&#x27;m missing or the explanations come with loads of other lingo and assumptions about my current knowledge. After failing to understand an explanation, I feel I shouldn&#x27;t ask again for fear being labelled &quot;dumb&quot; (after all, everybody else seems to be doing well). I also try to take notes, but after a while I just end up with a pile of disjoint pieces of information.<p>Has anyone felt like me? Have you found techniques and strategies to cope with this that you could share?<p>Or anything really. Points of view and opinions are very much appreciated as well.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I was using different tools to manage my content and design, and keeping everything in sync was becoming increasingly difficult.<p>That&#x27;s when I decided to build the Contentful to Figma plugin.<p>The plugin allows seamless integration between Contentful and Figma, so you can easily manage your content and design in one place. With the plugin, you can import your Contentful content directly into Figma in real-time. This saves a lot of time and makes your workflow much more efficient.<p>But the plugin&#x27;s capabilities continue beyond there. It also allows for multi-language support, making localization a breeze.<p>I&#x27;ve been using the plugin for my personal projects, dramatically improving my workflow and team collaboration. I am excited to share it with the community and see how it can benefit others.<p>Check it out on Product Hunt: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;contentful-to-figma-plugin<p>I hope you find it helpful, and happy hacking!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
