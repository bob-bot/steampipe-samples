  - Create financial data resources for other users to use in exchange for a fee
</code></pre>
Investors can combine multiple trading strategies to manage their portfolios. They can also subscribe to multiple real time financial data resources that could help with their financial advisory decisions.<p>The interaction with the platform can either take place manually through the website or automatically through an API (  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justfor.fund&#x2F;api_documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justfor.fund&#x2F;api_documentation</a>).<p>Next steps on the development of the company:<p><pre><code>  - Focus on retail investors&#x27; experience and involvement.
  
  - Implement seamless brokerage account creation depending on the region where the user is based.
  
  - Integrate other brokers to the platform (Ameritrade TD, Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, and more).
  
  - Make payment settlements within the platform more efficient and cheaper. (Currently using Paypal but I want to implement Payoneer and Stripe).
  
  - Raise capital for covering costs.
