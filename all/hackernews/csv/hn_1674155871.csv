Once I got the account and proved to myself that it should work, I started the process to get a business account.<p>The business account took a long time to get.  Probably 2 months.  The amount of information they asked for was quite surprising to me.  As a founder, I had never given this level of detail to anyone for any purpose.  I assumed that it was due to regulations Coinbase were under, but honestly, I do not know.  The end goal was important enough that I was willing to go along.<p>Once I went through the onerous process, I linked our business checking and purchased some BTC and tried to transfer it.  I was told there would be a 13 day hold on the funds before they could be transferred to my consultant.  I went through support and was told to use a debit card and there would be no hold.<p>Since I didn&#x27;t have a debit card, I had to get one.

I explained everything above and it came down to this:<p>&gt; A person can only have either a personal or business account, but not both<p>Let&#x27;s ignore the fact that they let me open both accounts and never said a word about it.  They even let me connect a debit card to my personal account and a checking account to my business account.<p>Next, they told me if I deleted my personal account I could add the debit card to my business account.  I did that.  No change.<p>I started a chat again and after a long time bumped it up a level and said someone would get in touch with me via email.<p>Yesterday I got an email that my new ticket was closed and asked if my issue was resolved.<p>At this point, I deleted my personal account and my business account is stuck in &quot;personal&quot; mode and I can&#x27;t add a debit card, so the hold time means it&#x27;s useless.<p>I just want people to know that Coinbase is a complete joke of a company.
