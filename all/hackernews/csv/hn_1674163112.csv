From a raw income perspective, I can fetch about 2-3x the CEO, and have alot more years of experience. I also have good general people&#x2F;product skills.<p>The reason I bring this up, my fear is that I will pound the pavement building the product. Initially the power&#x2F;direction of the company will be in my hands. But after a few years and de-risking&#x2F;gaining customers&#x2F;hitting PMF, the CTO role diminishes significantly relative to the CEO.<p>I ask because I do see myself resenting this situation. Clearly the answer is to found something myself. But lets put that aside.
