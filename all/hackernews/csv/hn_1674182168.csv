With just a simple description of the groove you&#x27;re looking for, our semantic search engine will output the most similar audio in seconds.<p>I used the Freesound.org API to upload over 3,000 grooves to MongoDB, and combined all the relevant data such as tags, title, description, BPM, etc. into OpenAI&#x27;s Text-Davinci to generate a unique description of each sound. I then embedded these descriptions using the Ada Embeddings Model and inserted them into Pinecone DB vector database, making it easier to find the perfect sound for your next project.<p>This search engine is designed to save you time and make your music production process more efficient. Give it a try and see the difference it makes in your workflow.
