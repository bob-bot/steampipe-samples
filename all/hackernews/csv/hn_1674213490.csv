We never went further into our Star Trek future than that? Like it was <i>Really</i> just about &quot;Being The First&quot; and once we had defeated that, well, heck, I guess we&#x27;ve done all we came here for. I mean, <i>can you really believe that</i>, that all the benefits of technological &amp; manned space exploration would yield to: economy and industry; human society, culture and metaphysics; US soft power; global unity and esprit de corps--we just <i>stopped</i>!? Seems kind of hard to believe that after those heady days there was it seems a steady wind down to our situation today, where: our commercial airflight tech has essentially not step-changed in 50 years; we haven&#x27;t put people onto any other celestial body (or even further out than Earth orbit); space propulsion is still based on rockets (now they&#x27;re...not like condoms!--I guess that&#x27;s something?); and as Peter Thiel (I suppose, love him or hate him?) has said: &quot;We were promised flying cars, all we got was 140 characters&quot; I&#x27;m sort of not buying it and thinking either (and this will surely gratingly rub some folks greatly the wrong way and be likely explained away by the simple mundanity of bureaucracy and the incompetence and short-sightedness of government, and &quot;low real-world utility&quot; of manned space flight): our culture is way more pathetic&#x2F;deceptive than it appears, or there was some secret space program that doesn&#x27;t get shared with the proles.<p>and<p>2) Was it, therefore, <i>really</i> better that we were &quot;First&quot; and not &quot;the Soviets&quot;. If there has been two poles competing continuously for title of &quot;Biggest Pole In Space&quot; {heh ;) social trope I guess?} then...might that constant state of State competition been better &quot;for all mankind&quot; than one where the game was quickly won and over and done?<p>Thinking on this as watching.
