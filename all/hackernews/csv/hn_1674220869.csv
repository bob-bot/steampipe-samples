As a result, prime real estate ownership, farmland, and locations with precious resources will likely become valuable investments.*<p>Reasoning:<p>- The emergence of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) will lead to rapid developments in other technologies, such as fusion power, which will greatly decrease energy costs.<p>- With companies like Boston Dynamics making strides in creating realistic robots with superior intelligence, we can expect to see a decrease in the need for human labor and access to intellect.<p>- This will lead to a reduction in the costs associated with construction, manpower, and other creative and intelligent pursuits.<p>- Despite the decrease in costs, land will still be limited, particularly in prime real estate locations. While construction may be cheap, the scarcity of land in desirable locations will make these properties highly sought after.<p>- The increasing availability of open-source AI development will lead to increased competition, making AI technology more accessible to individuals and small businesses.<p>- Even with advancements in agriculture and food production, precious resources will continue to be highly valued, particularly those used in the production of computer chips.<p>Thoughts?
