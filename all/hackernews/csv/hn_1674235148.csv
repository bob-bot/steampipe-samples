34456005,Konfig: A Framework and Toolset for Generating SDKs for Your REST API,2023-01-20T16:58:12Z,dphuang2,2,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"Hey Hackers,<p>My name is Dylan and I wanted to share with you my product Konfig (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;konfigthis.com) - a framework and toolset to help generate SDKs for your REST API. Today we use it to generate SDKs for our customers.<p>Large API companies like Stripe and Plaid have amazing developer experiences in part due to their client SDKs. But most API companies do not have the bandwidth or expertise to create and maintain SDKs. With Konfig, we want to make publishing SDKs easy without compromising quality. There are great open source projects like OpenAPI Generator (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openapi-generator.tech) that exist, but generating SDKs is still hard for two reasons.<p>First, it is difficult to write your OpenAPI Specification in a way that generates high quality SDKs since there are no standard best practices. And the ecosystem for generating OAS from code is immature (besides FastAPI &#x2F; Swagger). So we built a linter that integrates with VSCode and a CLI that can automatically fix your OAS to quickly improve your OAS.<p>Second, maintaining SDKs is a pain since you have to continuously rerun the generators, test the output, properly update versions, and publish to package managers. Konfig defines a convention for organizing your SDKs and automates the linting, generation, testing, versioning (thanks to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.useoptic.com), and publishing of your SDKs upon changes to your OAS.<p>I have experience working on similar projects - before building Konfig, I spent 3 years building a DSL for implementing highly relational and big data systems at C3.ai. The DSL was used to generate millions of lines of Java to serve thousands of APIs. We created client SDKs in JavaScript, Python, and Java but it became a such a huge pain to ensure the consistency and correctness across SDKs that we created a language-agnostic framework for generating tests (we called it Polytest).<p>A few companies are using Konfig and we are currently looking for more API companies interested in publishing SDKs for their API. I would also love to just hear your experience providing SDKs for your API and thoughts on the API specification ecosystem as a whole. Today Konfig is not well documented and we currently operate our product on behalf of our customers but hope to improve the documentation and developer experience. But feel free to use our Spectral based linter to determine if your OAS is in good shape for SDK generation https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.konfigthis.com&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;setup-linting.<p>We have some pretty cool ideas in the pipeline such as:<p>- building a generator with a better intermediate representation (IR) and templates to support ergonomic SDK features such as parameter state tracking and pagination
- generating docs with user code samples from the SDKs like how Stripe does it
- test case transpiler to help generate test cases in multiple languages by just writing in one (the base language is probably going to be Java for its nominal type system which is helpful for referencing schemas from the OAS but we haven’t decided yet)
- OAS vendor extensions for that can describe test cases to be generated for all SDKs<p>I hope you find our product interesting and I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Sometimes it can be so toxic that you&#x27;d consider ending it all (as i did) because there is no visible way out and keeping the money flowing in at the same time when people depend on you. I am here to say thats not the case. Good stuff can happen.<p>Under another name on here I wrote about my previous job and I felt stuck because if I left I walked away on a large chunk of stock options. That and my age made me feel really depressed and unwanted.<p>I was driven to actively contemplate suicide due to my boss and his shitty attitudes and issues but no one actually seemed to care. Even then I convinced myself with &quot;aww, it&#x27;s not so bad&quot; when in reality it was absolutely horrific. Getting out of bed became a real battle. People bitch about people being too lazy to get out of bed but some of those people will not be able to get out of bed because they are so depressed they see no point in it because &quot;it&#x27;s still gonna suck&quot;. I was so sidelined that I could literally disappear for an entire day&#x2F;days and no-one would notice.<p>I had a &quot;top 10 dick of the year&quot; award boss who didn&#x27;t like me at all and proactively sidelined me so much it left me nothing to do on a daily basis. That said, in a large company you can cruise for years and that&#x27;s what I did. The previous boss was a good guy but he left to pursue better options. Things where quite good back then actually.<p>Just doing nothing sounds awesome. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s crap. Imagine having to sit at a workstation for months and years, having to be &quot;present&quot; with nothing to actually do but make some some BS stuff to appear busy. Even doing training courses and such becomes boring after a while. It was a kind of mental prison and my boss truly didn&#x27;t give a flying you-know-what. Imagine having nothing in your week to justify the normal desire to do something useful. I even wrote scripts to make life better but my boss wouldn&#x27;t consider them because I wrote them.<p>Anyhow, it all came to a head and I ended up moving on... (cant go into that too much) and my new job pays much better money and is 500% more interesting and I get to play with cool new technologies. It makes you realise what crap you will really put up with and how from an impartial viewpoint you should have just &quot;nope&#x27;d&quot; out of it years ago but the status-quo is just easier to maintain.<p>Looking back at it I knew my time was up a long time ago but I didn&#x27;t have the courage to jump. It caused me so much misery and anguish. Looking back on the experience, I wasted several years of my life working for someone who didn&#x27;t nurture or appreciate talent with his sociopathic tendencies. It&#x27;s only after all these things have happened that you realise the effects it had.<p>As an example, my faith in myself is utterly crushed. My new boss has recognised a lot of the mental snot has been virtually beat out of me and is understanding and I am grateful for that and is very helpful.<p>Recovery will take time but at least I know I wont get verbally berated every time something isn&#x27;t perfect.<p>For those that this resonates with, I am not saying jump out right now but plan to just get out, even if a new job pays less or means going into a less demanding job. You can always make more money later but you can&#x27;t get your time back. I suspect it will take years to get my confidence back but I am so glad to be out of a terrible situation.<p>It&#x27;s only when you leave you realise how truly terrible it was.
