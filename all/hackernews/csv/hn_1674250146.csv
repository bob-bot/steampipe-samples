I&#x27;ve dabbled in every kind of online trade imaginable, from domain names to crypto. I&#x27;ve built and sold multiple websites. I also built and sold a small agency.

I can do some marketing, some coding, some design, some sales, but I&#x27;m not particularly good at any of those in isolation.<p>This used to make me feel really good when I was in my 20s, but as I&#x27;m getting older, this lack of institutional belonging is becoming unnerving. The only friends I have - from school - will talk about colleagues and office and job titles, and I have no clue how to contextualize it.<p>I&#x27;m in the process of building a new business and the fact that I don&#x27;t know what goes into hiring, onboarding, and building out processes for an employee freaks me out a little.

I have seen a suggestion that keep 50&#x2F;50 but vesting schedules should handle this, but I think that doesn&#x27;t really account for things properly either. I think you should want all co-founders on the same vesting schedule to keep their interests aligned.<p>I have been thinking instead about the following scenario:<p>* Whatever has vested, stays vested with the original co-founder.<p>* The remainder goes into a founder pool and is divided equally by all parties moving forward.<p>* The 4 year clock resets for all parties involved at that point (but with no cliff for the original parties).<p>Does this seem equitable?
