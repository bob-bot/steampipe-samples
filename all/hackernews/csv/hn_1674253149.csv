I have the skills to make an MVP and have mapped out much of the later roadmap, but I don&#x27;t have the time to do it given that I&#x27;m a senior engineer at a startup and already swamped with work. The other issue is that I feel strongly about needing to build the product in accordance with my vision.<p>$ .&#x2F;pls_help.sh --verbose<p>I know that an idea is just an idea, and on their own ideas are not very special (possibly debatable...). But I&#x27;ve been thinking about this one, and working on parts of it, for the past three or so years.  One thing that sets off some alarms is that I haven&#x27;t recanted the idea, even after thinking about it ad nauseam for so long. Actually, the opposite has happened - the utility that can be added with this project keeps on growing with more ideas and refinements. After years of doing creative and technical work that has rarely, if ever, happened. The small group of people that I&#x27;ve trusted to discuss parts of the idea and designs with have told me they&#x27;ve recognized the problem and even thought of ways to improve it themselves, but not the way I&#x27;m proposing it. They unanimously urged me to build it, like, yesterday.<p>The issue is, I have a job that doesn&#x27;t leave me enough time to put as much energy as I think is required into building this. And I&#x27;m not going to leave any time soon because I&#x27;m growing, learning, and building a ton there and I love it.<p>Frankly, the product itself is a pretty obvious thing and it blows my mind that nobody has even attempted it. But every discussion and article I see about the topic is missing the crucial factors that made the few people who heard my idea urge me to build it. If it&#x27;s done right, it really has the potential to be ~insert grandiloquent word here~.<p>Empty social hype aside, if this is adopted even partially, there would likely be a significant sum of money coming my way given the nature of the domain. That&#x27;s a possibility that I need to defend and actively try to make a reality. Historically, I have been too shy and wimpy, and have done a lot of work without pay or recognition, especially as a video editor before I became a software engineer. But I know what I have here and I don&#x27;t want to let it slip away or give it away without credit.<p>Like I said, the scope is massive, and the most I could conceivably do myself is build a strong foundation. Even that will take months of serious work and effort. The one thing that comforts me is that I know how incredible this could be if it was executed slowly, very thoughtfully, and with great attention to detail. Not to mention research and testing. Which is why I&#x27;m confident that if&#x2F;when someone makes something similar first, especially if they do it with typical startup haste, mine would be better. I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong though.<p>The problem that I&#x27;m trying to solve has an incentive for progress to be made soon. Ultimately, the product would be a general improvement to one pretty important aspect of society, so if someone makes it the way I think it should be made before me, then I&#x27;ll be sending them flowers and a thank you note.<p>This has been bugging me for years, and I&#x27;m starting to make some actionable progress on a small MVP. In addition to the software and designs that I already have, I&#x27;m working on a deck. But I&#x27;m scared to show it to anyone for fear of them running away with it. There are a couple people I trust, one with connections to a relevant player in the field. Should I just build out the MVP and make a killer deck? I&#x27;m not sure if VC money would be a good influence on this project because I want to prioritize doing it right over doing it fast. And by nature it will be quite profitable. If anyone has some advice on what paths to take, I would really appreciate it.<p>Thank you!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
