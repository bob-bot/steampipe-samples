I do not know much about Kubernetes at this moement. I am wondering if it will help me manage multiple containers better or something like Portainer would be sufficient. For some years now my approach to most of the tech decisions have been &quot;you will discover when you need $SHINY&quot;.<p>I am wondering when you guys realize you needed Kubernetes in your setup. What were the key factors that led to this realization? After using it for some time, at this moment, do you think it was worth it?<p>Thanks.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34464365,Ask HN: Advice on my method of Market Research,2023-01-21T06:26:06Z,prakhar897,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;m researching lots of markets right now and I go by a few specific approaches.<p>1. Figure out places where the target users hang out online. It could be subreddits, facebook groups, discord etc<p>2. Post on hangout places about the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve. This helps me in identifying if the problem actually exists or not and about any existing products. You can actually find a subreddit for almost any niche you want to serve to so problem feedback from reddit is invaluable.<p>3. After identifying a problem, I do a &quot;Roast My Startup&quot; post where I list out all the pain points and how our features will help in solving. This helps me gauge how badly the product is needed.<p>4. I create a quick landing page with an email attached and market it to the same places. I get quick data of how many buyers there will be initially.<p>5. Occasionally, I also do cold outreach if I think a user is a perfect fit.<p>6. Once I get hands on some very willing target users, I try to schedule a call to learn about the problem in more depth.<p>I realize that I&#x27;ve read a few books and don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any gap in my knowledge. Can the gurus here vet the process and point out any wrongdoings. Thanks!!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
