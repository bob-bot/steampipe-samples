34465814,Ask HN: Alternative ways to partner with a software consultancy company,2023-01-21T11:56:58Z,mfalcon,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve been working as a Data Scientist for more than five years (I worked as a Software Engineer before) as an employee but some months ago I&#x27;ve started taking freelance jobs. I&#x27;ve already two clients paying me to build data infraestructure, analytics, demand forecasting, RFM models creation and some other things.<p>My idea is to slowly build a data science consulting firm, leaving my full time job to focus on it. Some days ago I&#x27;ve talked with a colleague who already has a traditional software company and he told me he&#x27;d like for me to start a data science vertical on his company, but that we&#x27;d need to think how to work together.<p>The company has 25 employees and does traditional software engineering. I&#x27;ve been thinking about some alternative ways to partner with them but I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re nonsense or not:<p>- Partner up with them, get a percentage of the company. I don&#x27;t know if asking for this would be realistic, they&#x27;ve been growing the company for several years. But on the other side, I think that if we get this vertical right, the upside could outgrow their current offerings. What do you think? Is asking for something like the 20% of the company totally out of place?<p>- Start working with them as a &quot;data science director&quot; or something and getting a monthly paycheck as an employee. But if after a year we accomplish some previously defined goals, I&#x27;ll become a partner with a percentage of the company. Makes sense?<p>- Help them start the vertical as a consultant: train some people, help them in the initial meetings with clients and then leave.<p>What do you think? Is there another alternative way? Do you have a similar experience to share? What would you suggest if you were in my place?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
