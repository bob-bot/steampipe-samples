Then he became CEO of Open AI?

* Published AI research
* Sold a company
* Worked at a Unicorn or top tech company
* Reputation in OSS as a hacker&#x2F;builder<p>Surely there&#x27;s more to the story? Do people who he has advised at YCombinator all agree he&#x27;s brilliant and insightful?  What am I missing?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
