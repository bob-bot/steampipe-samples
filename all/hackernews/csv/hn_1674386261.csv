But every time I need to update Harbor to a new version I whish to knew a good alternative which is easier to maintain and is secure by default.<p>What bothers me the most is the following:<p>1. the poorly implemented recommendation of the docker compose installs in contrast to the k8s variant. I need to run it with docker compose for now.<p>2. to manually search for new version numbers and then need to download GitHub release tarballs<p>3. to manually run database migrations scripts before starting new major harbor versions<p>4. to have it by default control the whole host you run it on: Host port 80 and 443 usage. Mounting root &quot;&#x2F;&quot; by default in the harbor container during the migration process<p>Do you know a good alternative which is FOSS and can be selfhosted?,story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
