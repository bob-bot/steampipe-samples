And what distinguishes it from other AI avatar generators is, you can create as many AI avatars as you want, after training it once. Price for just generation is $0.01 per image(4k upscaled as well). Instead of using costly third-party APIs for training, inference, and upscaling, I&#x27;m using Runpod, which offers the lowest costs possible. The only way to get lower costs is getting so much volume that I can afford multiple GPU servers full time.<p>I somehow missed the boom in AI avatar generators over the last two months, and in this fast-moving field, it feels like you can become obsolete if someone else gets there even a week before you.
