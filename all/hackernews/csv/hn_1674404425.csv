34478365,How should I manage and develop my open-source project?,2023-01-22T15:38:40Z,syumei,2,false,false,1,[34478486],<null>,<null>,<null>,"I have developed one OSS tool (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Koukyosyumei&#x2F;AIJack), and I would like to ask how I manage it and where I should focus.<p>This OSS aims to simulate the security and privacy risks of Machine Learning. This tool allows users to experiment with various combinations of attacks and defenses against ML&#x2F;DL models, such as Model Inversion Attacks, Poisoning Attacks, BackDoor Attacks, Differential Privacy, Encryption, K-Anonnymization, and Federated Learning. I have implemented these algorithms with Python and C++. I use black, isort, pytest, and codacy to check the quality of codes. I also generate the documentation with sphinx, but the quality is not high. The coverage of test codes is around 70%.<p>Since I do not have much experience with OSS projects, I don&#x27;t know the best practices for OSS management and development. For example, I guess I should do the following:<p>- Improving the coverage of test codes<p>- Making documents more informative and clearer<p>- Writing blog posts (in many languages)<p>- Implementing more algorithms<p>- Unifying APIs for different algorithms<p>- Create some good-first-issuesfor new contributors<p>- Gathering contributors, etc<p>How should I prioritize them? How do you keep motivated? Some people demand a lot without gratitude or contributions (of course, most people are really lovely!). I will be a senior in April, so I must also prepare for MS or Ph.D. applications. I also have to work for my tuition. How much time do you usually spend on OSS? Should I focus on other things like research internships?<p>Any suggestions are really welcome —many thanks for considering my question.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
