Much has been written about their separation, but it is all based on shody research and downright speculation.<p>Bill &amp; Mel were doing just fine. Cash was still rolling in, the kids were finally out of school, the Foundation working like clockwork and breaking through each and every one of its milestones. Yet Bill could not help but notice that Mel had been aloof.<p>Bill had just picked up on a slight increase of their electricity bill as of late. When he had inquired Mel as to the nature of this increase beyond half a standard deviation, she shrugged it off as an ordinary consequence of her now more frequent use of the hair dryer. “The hair dryer?”, Bill thought to himself. This could only be the harbinger of graver news, like a sudden change of a partner’s clothes or perfume. But it was not until later one night when the truth would finally dawn upon Bill.<p>Bill arrived home late on a gray and rainy night, unexpectedly. He was meant to be in a meeting at the Foundation, but the adjoint members of the board, whose presence was required for that meeting, had been stranded by a local flood and the meeting had been called off. As he walked into the house, the creaks on the wooden floor foreshadowed what was yet to unfold.<p>The house was dark but for a glimmer of light coming from upstairs. The silence in the rooms was unusual and louder than the thunderstorm outside. As Bill walked up the staircase and finally gave that one gentle push on Mel’s office door, the truth flashed through his soul and blinded his eyes: Mel had installed a copy of Gentoo GNU&#x2F;Linux on her computer.<p>Overwhelmed and bewildered, Bill stormed out of the house and into the backyard. The uptick of electricity use, of course, had not been because of the hair dryer, but because Mel had compiled the latest version of the KDE desktop environment, only to get a couple of defines wrong and have to recompile it several times over before arriving at her ultimate GNU&#x2F;Linux setup.<p>Yet none of this computed inside Bill. For a split differential of time, the raw thought of installing a copy of Gentoo GNU&#x2F;Linux for himself had crossed his now feeble mind. “Sinner!”, he cried out loud inside his head to himself, “The temptation of the source makes us weak!” Yet the spectres of the Four Freedoms now besieged his mind, casting flashes of indescribable horror that had rendered him unable to muster yet the most trivial of his thoughts. The insurmountable terror of sharing and giving back to the community had taken a deep hold of him, severed the body from the soul, the former now a senseless sack of meat and bones. And yet, as if by a strike of litigation, Bill finally regained enough of himself to crawl back from otherworld through the windows of reality and issue one final command; “Enough!”, he declared, banishing the evil from the backyard. He did not want any of this, and he would have none of it. William Henry Gates III was on his own.<p>---<p>This story has been typeset in Emacs.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
