Or to put it a different way &quot;What if&quot; feedback. &quot;If you did this, the data would change in this way&quot; is visualized across many different dimensions, allowing you to &#x27;feel your way&#x27; through feedback where you wish to go.<p>In other words, you give your computer your input data, and you modify dimensions which allow you to specify what you want the program to do.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not searching for specialized interpretations of this &quot;Oh someone did this with typography&quot; or &quot;Oh someone did this with a game&quot; but rather some more generalizable form like &quot;Someone tried to replace Python with an idea like this&quot;<p>I suppose the nearest thing I can think of is manually modifying the parameters of a neural net but that&#x27;s perhaps too cumbersome because there are so many. Perhaps if you can put an autoencoder on top of that, and reduce the parameters down to a smaller &quot;meta&quot; set of parameters that you can manipulate which manipulate the population of parameters in the larger neural net?<p>I&#x27;m just really curious if there have been instantiations along these lines (as opposed to code live-running with results on the sides).<p>I realize this is all quite difficult, may even seem &#x27;impossible&#x27; to have some sort of generalizable system that does this for all sorts of programs. I&#x27;ve heard people say it can&#x27;t be done, and code is the ideal format. I hold that in abeyance, I don&#x27;t really know, but intrigued to discover those who have a counter perspective to that and have attempted to build something.<p>Also really curious if you know other similar people to Bret Victor I should check out!",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
