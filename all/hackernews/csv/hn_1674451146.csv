Has anyone else noticed how many people now start their sentences with, &quot;I mean...&quot;?<p>Though it&#x27;s not a holey new phenomenon, it does seem to be one that&#x27;s relatively recent. I&#x27;m noticing it all. The. Time. I even hear radio broadcasters say it once in a while. It&#x27;s common in business meetings across generations (I interact with a lot of Gen X and Millennials).  People will even post comments, starting a sentence with &quot;I mean...&quot;.<p>It doesn&#x27;t even seem to be used in a way that makes any sense sometimes (see the first line of this post).<p>Am I just hyper sensitive to it, or is it something that&#x27;s become a linguistic cultural phenomenon people have become accustomed to, similar to people saying &quot;...um...&quot; in the middle of sentences?<p>What DO you mean?! What does &quot;I mean...&quot; mean?<p>Who said it first? How did it catch on?  Why has it spread so fast?<p>It&#x27;s both slightly annoying to me, but more amazing that it&#x27;s just everywhere!
