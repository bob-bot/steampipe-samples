It got &quot;done&quot; some time thence, and <i>of course</i> one could not let the half-past just <i>be</i>. So here we are, for better or worse.<p>Thank you HN mods for helping me repost! _\\&#x2F;&#x2F;<p>The README explains all, animated GIFs and whatnot. Some assorted highlights:<p><pre><code>  - shite&#x27;s, ah, &quot;business logic&quot; (except templates) is about 300 lines of Bash, written in Functional Programming style [^]. Pipeline all the things!
  - The innards won&#x27;t surprise Perl&#x2F;PHP&#x2F;Shell gentleperson hackers from the last century.
  - The local hot reloading workflow is surprisingly nice, and occasionally hilarious! No JavaScript needed.
  - Full rebuilds are low performance and that&#x27;s fine :)
  - Pandoc is great.
  - Sometimes sed and regex is exactly the HTML parser you need. *Very* sometimes.
  - stdio buffering can mess you up
  - jq -Rr @html # escapes HTML; what?!
