We make it easy for e-commerce sellers to create clean, realistic, high-quality product images quickly and easily.<p>We started working on Stylized 3 months ago when sellers at craft fairs kept mentioning that simple white background photos (or silo photos) were a huge roadblock to running an online store. Our backgrounds are in computer vision, e-commerce, and VR, so it was only natural for this to be the solution we felt most excited about. Silo photos look simple, but the details have to be right, the product has to be accurately represented, the shadows have to look realistic. The goal is to first create professional product images, and from there start enabling editorials, brand marketing, and more - without having to sink time and money into traditional commercial photography.<p>We&#x27;re excited to share our project with the community and hear your thoughts. We&#x27;re passionate about using technology to solve problems and improve people&#x27;s lives, and we believe Stylized is a great starting point for most e-commerce sellers.<p>Thanks for checking out our project! We love feedback, so have at it!",story,https://www.stylized.ai/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
