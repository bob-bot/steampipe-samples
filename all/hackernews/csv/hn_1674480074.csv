This is partly because of a difference in engineering philosophy (he seems focused on box ticking rather than robust engineering) and because he treats engineers like mindless drones. I no longer enjoy going to work and dread our interactions, so have decided to move on.<p>I am very wary of explaining my justification for leaving in case the information gets back to him because it&#x27;s a small enough field (in this country) and he is already better established in the field. I expect he could make my life difficult should he choose. Also, I worry that mentioning these reasons could somehow be perceived as sour grapes.<p>That said, I also feel compelled to be honest as he is earmarked for an even more senior position if the project is a &quot;success&quot; (i.e., boxes ticked) and I feel bad for those left behind who have to maintain a system that was slapped together under the leadership of a manager who couldn&#x27;t care less about them.<p>Are you 100% honest when you resign or do you fob them off with a generic justification because the cons outweigh the pros?<p>PS I&#x27;m not alone in my read of the situation.
