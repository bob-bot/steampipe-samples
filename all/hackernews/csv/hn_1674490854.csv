Obviously details would have to be worked out, eg pre- vs post-tax income, potentially adding a large &quot;standard deduction&quot; before earnings are shared, and a minimum yearly income for the sharing to take effect in a given year and count towards the 10. Target yield would presumably have to be around 10-15%.
If there were such a deal available, would you as a high earner be interested? I&#x27;m wondering if I could make something like this happen for a group of us via private investment (think Yieldstreet and similar platforms).",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

I am happy to introduce you to Lingobo – an AI language partner<p>As someone who has studied French for 8 years and can read it fairly well, I still find myself at a loss when it comes to speaking it. My knowledge of French never seemed to translate into a useful active skill and I lacked the confidence to practice it in real-life conversations. This was a paradox I wanted to solve.<p>Utilizing GPT-3, I created a French language partner for myself, allowing me to practice conversational skills without worrying too much about grammar, tenses, and spelling.<p>I have since built it out as a web application named Lingobo and expanded it to include a total of 14 languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Russian, Indonesian, Hindi, and Dutch.<p>Hope you like it and find it useful!
