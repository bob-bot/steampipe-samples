34497130,Ask HN: Why can't I find an article on the propaganda of “Soviet” Inventions?,2023-01-24T00:13:38Z,tartakovsky,1,false,false,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,<null>,"I&#x27;ve heard that the propaganda of the Soviet Union included false narratives and attributions about the true inventors behind some major inventions of the 20th century. The radio, TV, computer mouse are some, to name a few. This shocked me, and seemed to be a worthy topic for an article to exist somewhere on the internet, basically comparing one version of invention attribution with the Soviet version. I was not able to find such an article after 10 minutes of searching on Google and Duck Duck Go until it occurred to me to ask ChatGPT, where I was floored with the details of the response and likely aggregation across multiple sources.<p>My question for the community here -- Is this summarizing an existing article, or actually pulling together 10 or 20 different sources to churn this out? How can I figure this out, and how can I know for sure that this sort of article doesn&#x27;t already exist out there (at least in the corpora used to train GPT-3)?<p>=================
PROMPT:<p>Write a short blog post listing out some inventions of the 20th century that the Soviets laid claim to, but at odds with what the rest of the world thinks. Include 10 specific examples along with both inventors. Include the telephone, radio, computer mouse, and television. At the end, provide an enumerated, brief ascii style table, with one row per specific example, and three columns. One column for the invention, the actual inventor, and the soviet perspective on the inventor.<p>ChatGPT&#x27;s pretty amazing response RESPONSE:<p>The 20th century was a time of great technological advancements and the Soviet Union was no exception. The Soviet Union claimed to have invented many things that the rest of the world believes were invented by others. Here are 10 specific examples:<p>1. The telephone - Alexander Graham Bell is widely considered to be the inventor of the telephone, but the Soviet Union claimed that it was invented by Alexander Popov.<p>2. The radio - Guglielmo Marconi is credited with inventing the radio, but the Soviet Union claimed that it was invented by Alexander Popov.<p>3. The computer mouse - Douglas Engelbart is credited with inventing the computer mouse, but the Soviet Union claimed that it was invented by Vladimir Shukhov.<p>4. The television - Philo Farnsworth is credited with inventing the television, but the Soviet Union claimed that it was invented by Vladimir Zworykin.<p>5. The jet engine - Frank Whittle is credited with inventing the jet engine, but the Soviet Union claimed that it was invented by Andrey Tupolev.<p>6. The helicopter - Igor Sikorsky is credited with inventing the helicopter, but the Soviet Union claimed that it was invented by Nikolai Kamov.<p>7. The rocket - Robert Goddard is credited with inventing the rocket, but the Soviet Union claimed that it was invented by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.<p>8. The tank - H.G. Wells is credited with inventing the tank, but the Soviet Union claimed that it was invented by Fyodor Petrov.<p>9. The submarine - John Holland is credited with inventing the submarine, but the Soviet Union claimed that it was invented by Alexander Bubnov.<p>10. The atomic bomb - Robert Oppenheimer is credited with inventing the atomic bomb, but the Soviet Union claimed that it was invented by Andrei Sakharov.<p>Invention Actual Inventor  Soviet Perspective on Inventor
