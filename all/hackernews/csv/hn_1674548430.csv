I want to end up creating my own tech startup in the future. I&#x27;ve heard if I want to do this, I should just start doing startups after college. However, I have a few concerns and thoughts of my own. What I&#x27;m saying next is due to my limited understanding of each field, so please correct any blatant mistakes you see me make.<p>My primary concern with working in startups after college is lack of name brand and unsure of career mobility. I worry that if I spend a long time building startups and failing, I will have very limited opportunities to enter big tech, or be heavily downleveled compared to starting in big tech.<p>Big tech is kind of the happy medium for me, I was wondering if staying for a few years here for the resume value and learning good software engineering principles would be valuable. Also, with the increased pay relative to startups, I feel myself feeling safer due to being able to build a bigger financial cushion for myself. But the pay is not as good as the HFT company and the skills won&#x27;t be as direct as working at the startup.<p>And the last option is HFT. Specifically, one of Jane Street&#x2F;HRT&#x2F;Jump Trading. The primary benefits I can think of are the extremely high pay and meeting very intelligent people. Going down this path would mean I would try to earn enough for financial freedom, and then join the startup world without worrying about money at all. In addition, I hope I can convince someone planning to end their quant career to join me in building startups. I also feel it&#x27;s the easiest to change out of HFT and into either big tech or startups. But my primary concerns is the lack of transferrable skills. I understand that working here will be very different from the vast majority of startup work.<p>I&#x27;m currently leaning towards the HFT route, but am feeling pretty lost and confused towards the entire thing. I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m making a big mistake, and would really appreciate if anyone had insight into this. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
