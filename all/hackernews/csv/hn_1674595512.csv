- Integrations for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Actions, Render, and Fly.io
- Public API
- User activity logs
- Point-in-time recovery and secret versioning
- Custom environments
- Kubernetes operator (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infisical.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;integrations&#x2F;platforms&#x2F;kubernetes"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;infisical.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;integrations&#x2F;platforms&#x2F;kubernetes</a>)
And made lots of other performance improvements both on the frontend and backend.<p>Our repo is published under the MIT license so any developer can use Infisical. The goal is to not charge individual developers. We make money by charging a license fee for some enterprise features as well as providing a hosted version and support.<p>In the coming weeks, we plan to add features like key rotation, alerts, and secret groups - as well as continue adding more integrations.<p>Give it a try (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Infisical&#x2F;infisical"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Infisical&#x2F;infisical</a>)!
