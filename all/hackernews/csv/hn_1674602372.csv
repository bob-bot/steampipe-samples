The source code can&#x27;t be used for commercial projects. I know this would be difficult to enforce, but having legal remedies for this in some jurisdictions is better than nothing.<p>2. People who contribute to the project would not own the source code.

The license could allow people to self-host their own instance, but again, only if it&#x27;s for non-commercial use. Ideally there&#x27;s some remedy for if the company goes bust or in a direction the user doesn&#x27;t like ... they could keep hosting it.<p>What existing type of license most closely matches this?
