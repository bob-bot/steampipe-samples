I haven&#x27;t regularly programmed in about 10 years. Most of my projects in that time have involved light web prototyping and quickly hacking things together for demos. It&#x27;s fair to say I couldn&#x27;t pass your average whiteboard or leetcode interview at this point.<p>I&#x27;ve started to lose passion for my role (and company) and am interested in building things again, likely at a small company or startup. After a lot of dabbling, I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;d like to transition to being an ML Engineer and I&#x27;m looking for advice on how best to make that happen. My questions are:<p>(1) What educational resources would you recommend, both in terms of helping me gain knowledge and improving my odds of getting a job? I&#x27;ve been working through Fast.ai, but am not sure if I should pursue others (Coursera, or even a Masters or Grad Certificate of some kind).<p>(2) For MLE interviews&#x2F;roles, will I need to display strong theoretical strength (i.e. in advanced statistics, ML foundations) or will applied knowledge and portfolio projects be enough?<p>(3) What strategy would you recommend for someone in my shoes? Fill a GitHub profile with projects and aim for entry level startup jobs? I&#x27;m willing to &quot;start at the bottom&quot; but would hope that my experience counts for something. Would any company even hire someone like me as an MLE?<p>I&#x27;d love any input to the above, but if you have general thoughts to share about someone in this situation that would also be helpful. Thanks.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
