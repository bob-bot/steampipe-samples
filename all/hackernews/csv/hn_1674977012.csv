Similar to Instacart.<p>Anyone knows how I can legally have ordinary people with cars to deliver goods? I use to be an Instacart driver on 2016. It was straight forward process and got hired quickly.<p>Things have changed now, I read that Independent drivers now need to be employees. Whats the deal here? I have no funds to pay hourly.<p>Worth getting into this niche or do I seriously need to start pitching for funds?<p>As a new startup can I legally hire drivers to deliver goods as independent contractors?<p>I don&#x27;t see why I should pay for a lawyer to do all of this answering since it&#x27;s such a simple business model and don&#x27;t even have customers yet, but if I need to then I guess I would.<p>Just want to know all of these things rather than sticking my head in the ground like an ostrich. Anyone got experience in this type of startup and how to go about it?<p>Thanks.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
