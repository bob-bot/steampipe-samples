(Show HN from around a year ago: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29254147). Basically, it&#x27;s a general-purpose browser automation tool like Selenium&#x2F;Puppeteer&#x2F;Playwright that anyone can use without writing code.<p>The Browserflow website includes examples of automations people often request, including scraping popular websites like LinkedIn. A few days ago, I received a cease and desist letter from LinkedIn: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browserflow.app&#x2F;linkedin.pdf<p>As a one-man operation with modest resources, I&#x27;m hoping I can get some help from the HN community in understanding what this means to avoid getting sued into oblivion. :)<p>At first I thought that I&#x27;d be fine if I removed all references to LinkedIn from the Browserflow website, but I&#x27;m not so sure about that. One of LinkedIn&#x27;s demands is to “Cease and desist developing, offering, or using software or programs with features developed, marketed, or intended for automating activity on LinkedIn’s website or app, scraping LinkedIn member data, or otherwise violating the LinkedIn User Agreement”.<p>Even if I removed all the LinkedIn examples, Browserflow could still be used to automate or scrape LinkedIn because, well, it&#x27;s a browser automation tool. Is LinkedIn demanding that I stop developing Browserflow altogether?<p>The letter cites hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp as the legal precedent for why Browserflow is in violation, but there are some differences between hiQ and Browserflow that I thought might be meaningful:<p>1. Browserflow is not designed specifically for scraping LinkedIn: It&#x27;s a tool for general-purpose browser automation, not a service that scrapes LinkedIn and resells the data.<p>2. Browserflow does not scrape LinkedIn on its own: Any automation of LinkedIn is initiated by the user using their own LinkedIn account.<p>2. Browserflow does not create or use fake LinkedIn accounts.<p>I&#x27;d be fine with removing all the LinkedIn examples from the website, but I&#x27;d like to continue building Browserflow because I love working on it and it&#x27;s my livelihood. I&#x27;d appreciate any advice or help. Thanks!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

For context, Metlo is an open source API Security tool[0] we launched here on HN a couple months ago[1].<p>After working with a few customers over the last couple months, we realized there was a gap in other API testing solutions; especially when it comes to writing security tests. So we decided to completely gut and revamp our testing product - sharing that with you all today!<p>Most Automated API Scanners only find generic vulnerabilities like misconfigured HSTS&#x2F;CORS Headers and miss vulns specific to your API’s business logic. Making custom tests in tools like Postman (which we love) requires you to manually write tests for every single endpoint. This is quite tedious and time consuming if you have hundreds or thousands of endpoints.<p>So we decided to make the API Security testing experience much faster and more seamless:<p>* With Metlo testing, you can write API tests in a YAML format (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metlo.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;writing-a-test).<p>* To make writing tests fast, Metlo supports autogenerating these tests with javascript templates (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metlo.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;example-templates). Templates for common vulnerabilities in the OWASP Top 10 like BOLA, Broken Authentication, Security Misconfigurations and more come built-in to Metlo. You can also make custom templates that are specific to your API.<p>* Once you have the right templates you can build rules to apply these templates to many endpoints at once (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metlo.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;test-rules). This makes it possible to write hundreds of tests against your API in just a few clicks :)<p>We have more info on our docs here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.metlo.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;writing-a-test. And here&#x27;s a demo video if you’d like a quick walk-through :) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;f342f186e756489aa7a500be875a5539<p>We’d love to hear your thoughts!<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;metlo-labs&#x2F;metlo
