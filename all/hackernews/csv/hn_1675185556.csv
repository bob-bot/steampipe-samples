Portable Secret&#x27;s mprime1 has little time for upkeep, so, with his blessing, PrivacyProtect picks up where he left off and incorporates the following updates,<p>- Improved security
  - SHA-512 and 2,100,000 iterations instead of SHA-1 and 1,000,000
  - Generate IV and salt at encryption time to prevent reuse
  - Clear forms on submit
- CLI: still WIP, but have a proof of concept working of using NodeJS&#x27;s WebCrypto APIs to create the HTML files without the UI
- Improved UI
  - Use type=&quot;password&quot; for password fields
  - Show&#x2F;hide password
  - Press enter to decrypt
  - Don&#x27;t show password hint if not provided
  - Use form HTML element<p>Play around with it, and let me know what you think!
