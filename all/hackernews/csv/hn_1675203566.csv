34602968,Starry Internet Leaving Columbus Ohio Market,2023-01-31T22:08:35Z,Severian,1,false,false,,,,,,"I thought I&#x27;d share this as I&#x27;m currently a subscriber of their service. I&#x27;ve had nothing but good things to say about them. Their line-of-sight wifi tech was very reliable.<p><pre><code>  January 31, 2023

  Dear XXXXXXXX,

  At Starry, we have always believed that being your internet service provider of choice is a privilege. And because of that privilege, our teams work around the clock to deliver a service experience that we believe is second to none. As a Starry customer, you’ve welcomed us into your home to keep your devices and your lives connected to the things that matter most to you, and being your ISP is a privilege we have never taken for granted. 

  That’s why it’s especially difficult to inform you today that beginning this spring, Starry will begin discontinuing its internet services in the Columbus, Ohio market. 

  We will be in contact with you to provide you with a more precise date regarding discontinuance of your Starry service. For now, you do not need to take any action. 

  We entered the Columbus market because we believe that everyone deserves a choice when it comes to internet service providers. We believe competition drives affordability and a higher quality of service. It’s our hope that even in our short time in Columbus we’ve made positive impacts across all of the communities we’ve served – whether it was through forcing incumbents to compete for your business or by making ultra-affordable broadband a reality for low-income households through our Starry Connect program.

  We’re deeply proud of what we built in Columbus, the lives we’ve impacted, and the team we brought together to serve you, our customer. We will be in further communication, but if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our customer support team at: support@starry.com. 

  Thank you for being on this journey with Starry. Long live #HappyInterneting.

  Sincerely,
  The Starry Team</code></pre>",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
