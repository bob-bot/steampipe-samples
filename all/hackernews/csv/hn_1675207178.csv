But there are many times in the course of a hectic work day where, for example, firing off a DM to someone in Slack by using dictation is fast and works well.<p>I wish dictation on MacOS didn&#x27;t feel like an afterthought or hidden feature like it does now (I should probably learn the keyboard shortcut because I always point and click Edit &gt; Start Dictation).<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m just curious if other people have started using dictation&#x2F;TTS more in recent years.
