A weirdly addicting (and expensive) hobby to have.<p>Back then i noticed something, it was quite tedious to easily sift and search through knives based on length, steel, brand, and what not to find the knife for me. There were some great youtube channels that helped me pick out what i wanted however i had to sit through multiple 30 minute videos just to review 10-15 knives or so each.<p>Recently i&#x27;ve been having a little trouble sleeping so i decided to pickup a new passion project to work on late at night, here&#x27;s KnifeGeek!<p>it&#x27;s a completely free website where you can search, filter, and sift through an extensive knife database (over 60K+ knives) and add them to your collection or wishlist. You do need to sign in to add stuff to your wishlist or collection and after a bunch of advanced searches.<p>Please check it out and let me know if you think anything is missing! I&#x27;ll try to flesh it out more on a daily basis if people find it cool or useful.<p>Planning to add in price comparison functionality and more data per knife in the next week.<p>PS: Images are a little shoddy, working on that.",story,https://www.knifegeek.io/,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
