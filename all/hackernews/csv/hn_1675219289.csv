34605598,Ask HN: How to get a job as a test case engineer for AI?,2023-02-01T02:32:59Z,logicallee,1,false,false,,,,,,"I recently had this interesting interaction with ChatGPT after receiving a notice that its mathematics ability has been updated (ChatGPT does all right for a while but then messes up):<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;HZWoy0T<p>I would be highly interested in working on developing test cases for AI, since I believe a lot of it could be done as a test engineer using Python.<p>For simple mathematics, for example, I believe that humans don&#x27;t usually learn from texts but instead are trained in elementary school to count things and reason about counting.  Likewise, I could engineer a Python program to output test questions to help train a general intelligence model by outputing new test questions.  We know that general intelligence will eventually be able to engage in mathematical reasoning, since humans do (who are neural nets) so it is a matter of architecture and training.<p>How could I get a job as a test case engineer for AI models, given that I know Python? If anyone knows any tips or has any connections, please let me know. I am also interested in automated testing of other aspects of AI.

34605521,Show HN: What do you want or expect from an antidetect browser,2023-02-01T02:22:33Z,kennethc,1,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN! I&#x27;m one of the creators of MoreLogin and we&#x27;re happy (and once again very nervous) to release this on HN. MoreLogin is an anti-detection browser, and the fact that there are already many anti-detection browsers on the market, even though we&#x27;ve been iterating on our anti-association capabilities to reach the top tier of the market, doesn&#x27;t seem to feel like much to users. We have also thought about developing features specifically for crypto users, such as specifically developing trading platforms and wallets that can connect to mt5 and coinigy, and making automated trading robots to support them, as well as developing features specifically for marketers, such as ensuring the success rate of account registration. We think it&#x27;s a cool idea, but it&#x27;s all just based on our own ideas and we really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s useful and if people will pay for it. So we wanted to see what needs people had for this kind of tool, this kind of browser, and what we could go to meet them.<p>Here&#x27;s the intro video we made a while back - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hW4O8yXe4r4"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hW4O8yXe4r4</a><p>Any feedback or questions are welcome! :) Thanks!",story,https://www.morelogin.com,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
