34606339,Ask HN: What is the future of cold-applying to jobs?,2023-02-01T04:25:14Z,amazonavocado,3,false,false,,,,,,"Currently, the common method in cold applications is to use online job platforms that hosts thousands of job listings and collect millions of applications. Most of the time, applicants are manually picking out the jobs that look interesting to them and then they apply. Sometimes there are shortcut options like LinkedIn&#x27;s Easy Apply. Some even have used the help of bots to speed up the process.<p>Could there be another approach that could overtake its effectiveness in the future? One idea I had is where instead of you choosing the job(s), you pick the criteria you want the job to include, and submit your job experience, and it&#x27;ll build a list of job openings around that. These results could be optimized according to the a higher likelihood of getting interviewed. Because even when you cold apply, you could still benefit from preventing as many automatic rejections as possible.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that is already being done somewhere but I&#x27;d be interested in reading about approaches on how it could be implemented.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
