A funny thing has happened to me after about 2 years of working at all of these companies: I completely lose interest in what I’m working on. I have always attributed this to some kind of combination of burn out and not feeling like the product was personally of interest enough to keep going, but it keeps happening regardless of what industry I am in, where in the tech stack, etc…<p>I am naturally interested in how computers work and always have been which is why I keep coming back for more, hoping a change of team &#x2F; company &#x2F; mission statement will be the missing factor, but I’m always left with the same frustrations.<p>It’s almost like the novelty of the problems that I am asked to work on wears off a little bit faster each time. I am not someone who can be given a task of any nature and find the act of understanding and working on this task fulfilling in its own right. I seem to want to believe there is a good reason for spending so much time and effort working on a problem, but more often than not am left disappointed. Some of the best engineers I have worked with have seemed to all enjoy their work so much that it didn’t matter what they were working on as long as it was challenging which I don’t seem to have the same love of the craft as they do.<p>I’m not sure if maybe programming should be more of a hobby for me and I just am not ever going to be someone who can enjoy working full time as an engineer, if I need to change my attitude, take more time off? If anyone has been in a similar situation I would love to hear your suggestions and what helped you.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

34607690,Ask HN: Would I be stupid to give up a big tech job?,2023-02-01T07:48:36Z,uejfiweun,2,false,false,,,,,,"Hi HN. I am a 26 year old who has been working as a full stack dev at a big tech company for the past 4 years. It&#x27;s a cushy gig. However, there&#x27;s a part of me that&#x27;s kind of bored with web dev and wants to take a crazy bet on something cool, like try to get into ML or ML research, or go back to school, or maybe go to work at a trading firm on wall street. I find myself daydreaming about such potential moves, but I always end up thinking to myself that my current situation is so lucrative that I might as well ride it out for as long as possible.<p>Has anyone had any experience with giving up a lucrative job like this to try and get into another area of CS? How did it go? It&#x27;s a tough call, I will definitely regret not getting into ML &amp; AI if it really picks up in the future, but I will regret leaving FAANG even more if the ML revolution doesn&#x27;t materialize &#x2F; if I fail. Should I just try to continue to ride the FAANG gravy train for as long as possible, <i>then</i> try and do some other stuff?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
