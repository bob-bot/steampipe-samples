What&#x27;s an ideal way of setting up a multi-service server like this, and what security policies should I implement. Additionally what are some must haves that you have running on your servers?<p>I understand self-hosting is a huge labour of love, and I have no qualms in investing time&#x2F;effort learning :) 
Thank you for reading!<p>tl;dr got a server, want to self-host things, how do I secure it&#x2F;what all do HN&#x27;ers have running on their servers.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
