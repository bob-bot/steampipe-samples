It was s Fridays and I think I was on my 5th or 6th bugfix of the day. I asked the QA manager if it was ok if I went home early at 6.00pm an she said yes.<p>On Monday when I got back in at 8.00 I had a real stinker of an email saying &quot;the devs&quot; (i.e. me) shouldn&#x27;t leave the system in a bad state and that even more overtime was on the card. He then pulled us all in a meeting and basically said that the code wasn&#x27;t good enough and it was all our own fault. Totally ignoring that we were rewriting the mess that the outsourced contractors had gotten away with but no it was all the permies fault.<p>The software itself was a complete disaster and actual failed to calculate interest payments on millions of dollars worth of accounts on Xmas eve because the customer had booked &gt; 1 million transactions on a single day.<p>The director who chewed me out was later demoted and after this you seen a real change in attitude were he was much less shouty.,story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This setup works mostly fine, however, it would be nice to have a more powerful desktop at home. I&#x27;ve been wondering if there are any easy and reliable ways to keep the files between two machines in sync? I use Linux so I would basically want to sync the entire home directory. Or am I just better off continuing with my current laptop + dock setup, and upgrading to a more powerful laptop if needed?<p>All methods I&#x27;ve found have tradeoffs. Using network storage is one obvious solution, but it doesn&#x27;t work well if you are in a place with bad connectivity. Manually syncing files with for example rsync and an external drive works, but it&#x27;s time consuming.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
