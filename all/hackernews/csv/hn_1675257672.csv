Perfect for small teams that do not need any of the advanced features that paid platforms offer, but still want to have an easy to use centralised place to edit these strings.<p>Without creating any account or whatsoever, you can use the Localeasy endpoint to convert your sheet into translations files for multiple platforms: iOS&#x2F;macOS, Android, Rails, JSON, or YAML.<p>I would love to hear your feedback!",story,https://localeasy.deno.dev,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Which is why I&#x27;m asking for help.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve been applying to remote jobs, but literally all of my applications have been rejected or ghosted. It&#x27;s so much different than when I was looking a couple years ago. I&#x27;m in my mid-20s, with 7-8 years of professional experience and have been programming since I was a kid. I have FAANG names on my resume, jobs and internships (when I was a student). I consider myself a reasonably good engineer - I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m hot shit, but I would&#x27;ve expected to get to the first screening at least somewhere.<p>Has the landscape changed so much in the past few years?
