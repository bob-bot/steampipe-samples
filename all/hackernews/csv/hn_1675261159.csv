34610686,Show HN: We built a developer-first open-source Zapier alternative,2023-02-01T14:15:53Z,eallam,1,false,false,,,,,,"For the past few months we‚Äôve been building Trigger.dev and can now share our beta with you: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;triggerdotdev&#x2F;trigger.dev"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;triggerdotdev&#x2F;trigger.dev</a>. Trigger.dev is an open source platform that makes it easy for developers to create event-driven background tasks directly in their code. You write workflows using our SDK, and can view all the runs in our web app.<p>Why we built this:<p>- We found current workflow &#x2F; automation tools like Zapier and n8n are good for simple tasks, but not for more advanced use cases.<p>- Dropping down into code in these tools is just not a great experience. We prefer using our own IDEs, version control, and having access to GitHub Copilot etc.<p>- Sometimes, a workflow requires us to query a database or handle some sensitive information. It would be great if this data wasn‚Äôt sent to a third party.<p>Our beta version lets you:<p>- Trigger workflows from webhooks, custom events or schedules (CRON)<p>- Use API integrations with Slack, GitHub, Shopify and Resend. We‚Äôre adding more of these each week.<p>- Add delays of up to 1 year. Workflows will resume where they left off, even if your server has gone down.<p>- Support for Fetch and subscribing to generic webhooks.<p>- Observe every workflow run in the app (great for debugging).<p>- Open source MIT license so anyone can self-host the platform.<p>We‚Äôre still early so would love your feedback and opinions. Feel free to try us out for free ‚Äì and if you want a specific API integrated, just let us know.<p>Main website: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trigger.dev"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trigger.dev</a>
