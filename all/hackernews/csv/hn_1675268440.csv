It&#x27;s free to download and use, and I&#x27;d be grateful for any feedback or suggestions.<p>Features:<p>&gt; 4 difficulty levels, accessible at any time<p>&gt; No personal data collection of any kind<p>&gt; Clean, minimalistic design that focuses on the game<p>&gt; Takes up significantly less space than other popular apps (by a factor of about 10x)<p>&gt; Minimal use of advertisements<p>I was frustrated by how many of the popular Sudoku apps feel excessively over-engineered, consume a lot of storage space and some that even collect unnecessary personal information, like location and contacts. So I put this app together without any of those things (using flutter).<p>Links:<p>iOS: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;sudoku-puzzle-palace&#x2F;id1668683822<p>android: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.kingfishertech.sudoku<p>Here&#x27;s a screenshot of the main app page: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;FbCf2IJ<p>Thanks for taking a look and happy solving!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

[1]<p>This synth is GPL3 (or rather, was until the .01 update which has accompanied the change of licence), and the GPL3 code is still up on github[2].<p>Is it OK for me to do a release of this from the GPL3 code that I have now forked on github[3]?  As I understand it, it should be, but I&#x27;ve not done anything like this before.  The code was actually a fork of someone else&#x27;s abandoned code that they got permission for, and they apparently have permission of the original writer to make it private now.<p>[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discodsp.com&#x2F;obxd&#x2F;
