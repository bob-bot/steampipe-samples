34613188,Ask HN: Best approach for mixed Windows / Linux environments with HPC?,2023-02-01T16:44:49Z,globoxer,1,false,false,,,,,,"I will preface this by saying I am not really an IT person but more a very heavy IT&#x2F;HPC end user (I do lots of engineering simulations on HPCs). My group is trying to push for more simulation focused workflows at my company but are hitting some IT hurdles that the IT group here doesn&#x27;t seem able to solve. They have thrown up their hands, but I think there has to be a solution out there.<p>Our setup: We have windows workstations, Active Directory managing folder and account access, and a Dell Isilon for file storage. This works fine on windows and even with our old janky Windows HPC. I submit a job, it can retrieve the required files with my credentials from the network share etc and everything works ok.<p>We need to move to a Linux HPC (supports a required simulation tool and the workflow is just better all-around especially for automation etc).<p>What is the best authentication file sharing for Linux hosts? Right now, we figured out how to join the HPC to the AD domain so my account is the same between Linux and Windows, but I have to make a kerberos ticket on the linux HPC (and all its compute nodes) so that I can access files from the network share via CIFS. This is a pain and I usually just copy files to my Linux home dir and then copy them back to the network share where this data needs to live. Otherwise I have to maintain active CIFS mounts and their associated kerberos tickets on all the compute nodes.<p>Is there a way that the linux hosts can function like windows ones? Where the head node can submit my job for me (as me) to a compute node and it can access the files from the network share using my credentials without me making a script that keeps kerberos tickets CIFS mounts alive all the time?<p>Apparently we tried accessing the same network share that we do via CIFS using NFS, but I am told that the folder permissions were not respected (ie NFS users had access to folder they otherwise should not have access to if they had used a kerberos ticket and CIFS).<p>TLDR: What approach should I use for enforcing file permissions from Active Directory and be able to access those files from Windows and Linux hosts? I am especially interested in an HPC environment where a head node submits jobs as me to compute nodes, those compute nodes need to be able to access the file share with the proper file permissions.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
