Knowing the distaste for union labor in the West, especially in the tech industry, what are the next steps.<p>* Can we coordinate secretly, without letting management know?
* Can we avoid preventative firings of organizers?
* Can we do this while providing meaningful material improvement in outcomes for all tech workers without being suborned by leftist-style factionism?<p>I hope everyone laid off comes back ready to acqui-unionize.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
