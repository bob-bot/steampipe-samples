I was trying to give a time around 1 hour to apply changes which I made, but after that time, running query directly against Crazydomains DNS servers shows that changes haven&#x27;t been applied.<p>I opened ticked with them, and they told me that it will make 2-4 hours to apply my changes made by web gui. It&#x27;s quite long time for wait, but I did wait until next day. In mean time, someone from Crazydomains support decide to switch default name servers in my domain to Premium one as I have this option under my account, which completely cut off DNS resolution to all my services, as Premium Name Servers have no knowledge about my domain. I had to open another ticket about this .<p>Next day, my TXT record was still not updated so I follow with primary ticket, and  send back and forward updates about this issue. Next day, 48 hours after record change, it was still not updated in Crazydomains Name Servers. I contacted them, and they magically &quot;did something&quot; (I guess reload zone manually) and record was updated.<p>I decide to run test and I modified TXT record again 5 hours ago, and situation is time same - in web gui record is updated but on their Name Servers not.<p>Does anybody experiencing or experienced this same issue with Crazydomains ???",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
