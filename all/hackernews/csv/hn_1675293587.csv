34618883,Ask HN: Taboo meats and lab grown products,2023-02-01T22:27:17Z,dieselgate,1,false,false,,,,,,"It seems some animal meats are considered illegal&#x2F;taboo to eat such as horse or dog (in the US - no opinions&#x2F;judgements on existing norms worldwide). Recently came across an article about the moral dilemma about a vegetarian trying out &quot;cultivated&quot; or lab grown meats - harvested from an living animal&#x27;s cells.<p>Does anyone think this may ever be used for &quot;non-conventional&quot; meat animals? Just kind of a moral thought experiment which may be relevant for the HN crowd.<p>For example - it&#x27;s commonly stated that tortoise meat is &quot;incredibly good&quot;, would there be a potential niche market for lab grown tortoise meat?<p>This is a somewhat weird topic and I don&#x27;t personally eat meat nor feel the need to try out &quot;non-conventional&quot; rarities - just a general thought. My aversion to meat is that it just kind of grosses me out, not just the &quot;processing&quot; but also the smells, raw meat texture, bad quality products, etc. Do not expect lab grown products to change this for me personally.<p>Relevant article which spurred this topic: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;2023&#x2F;01&#x2F;mission-barns-lab-grown-meat-live-animals-taste-test-ethical-eating&#x2F;",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
