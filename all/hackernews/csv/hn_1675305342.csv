34620897,Ask HN: Camunda 8 Bpmn – Thoughts?,2023-02-02T01:38:54Z,throwawaycam,1,false,false,,,,,,"I have to say, I am disappointed in the direction of Camunda 8 for the two reasons listed below.<p>1) BREAKING CHANGES: There are a lot of breaking changes that will be hard or time consuming to migrate. I agree with the general philosophy of the design decisions -- such as making each service essentially run as a job. However, it is simply not feasible to migrate a large application away given the number of breaking changes.<p>2) LICENSE: The new license structure is confusing, and not as permissive as Camunda 7s.<p>It sort of feels like they are trying to force everyone into their SAAS solution or into a paying customer. They do, however, have every right to do this.<p>Am I missing something with the direction of Camunda? What is a good alternative, specifically with great integration to Java?
