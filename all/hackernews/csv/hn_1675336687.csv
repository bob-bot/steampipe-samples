  - HR did (!), without at least asking to re-send from the professional mail account, preferably even signed and encrypted (as is nicely integrated in our email solution).
  - At pay day, HR transferred the salary to this new bank account
  - This scammer contacted them again, saying the salary was not  received; could they please transfer it again?
  - HR sent them some proof of payment, revealing some data related to me (legal entity of my employer with address, exact salary of that particular month)
  - After that, HR thought to probably ask me, at which point the fraud became clear.

HR tells me they&#x27;ll transfer the salary &#x27;soon&#x27;, so I&#x27;ll be kind to them and give them a couple of days.<p>What makes me feel bad particularly, is the data related to myself that leaked to this scammer in the process.<p>What would you do?
