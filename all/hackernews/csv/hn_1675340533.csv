34625224,Ask HN: How to earn some side income as a young developer?,2023-02-02T11:39:02Z,1nf_,1,false,false,,,,,,"For context, I am about to turn 17 and have experience developing full stack web apps for fun, and for friends and family for around 6 years now.<p>I would like to start building some financial independence so I can afford to travel and go to festivals etc. with friends. The default thing to do at my age is get a minimum wage job at a pub&#x2F;cafe and earn income that way, however I feel like I would rather work in something that complements my skills such as web&#x2F;software development. The problem I am facing is I just have no idea to find some part time&#x2F;freelance work at my age. Is it even worth chasing software work at 17 or should I just go for a waiter job and continue coding in my free time and developing skills while I am still in education?<p>Thanks",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
