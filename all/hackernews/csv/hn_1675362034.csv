There are different entity types and they can have relationships between each other.

Think of it as a big excel file, with each sheet representing a certain entity and then relationships are created using key&#x2F;foreign keys.<p>I am thinking however that this is not the optimal ways of managing parameters, and want to try to think out of the box a bit.<p>What are some of your thoughts&#x2F;ideas on how to approach this problem?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Spending time searching across multiple websites)<p>The question is, are they rewarding the owners of the data that have been used to train this models? While you would like to brush it off easily by saying that they use public information that are freely available on internet, I&#x27;d like you to consider that:<p>First, it has been already proven that some services, like autopilot, have used GPL code during training of the model (which should force share-alike licensing terms)<p>Second, currently available licensing doesn&#x27;t consider these use cases yet given that they&#x27;re pretty new and started to popup just recently.<p>Why is this important? Well, first because if content creators are not rewarded for their work, they won&#x27;t create content anymore and that would heavily influence the likelihood of having quality content to train new version of the model. While there are instances of quality content freely available (e.g. wikipedia) most of these cases are composed by no profit organizations that get fundings in a way or another.<p>Currently a big part of the web works in a very simple way: content creators create content, place some ads and, thanks to the traffic from search engines, get rewarded economically thanks to the ads revenue. Similarly, in other instances, there&#x27;s a revenue sharing model (e.g. it&#x27;s what has done the fortune of YouTube)<p>In future, if ChatGPT takes on, people could get information without even visiting a website, therefore not providing any sort of benefits to the content creator, which would likely stop to produce content (think about recipe websites)<p>Now that ChatGPT is going to charge 20$ per month per user, how much of this is going to reward who has provided the content (indirectly) instead of monetizing it only to the benefit of one company?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
