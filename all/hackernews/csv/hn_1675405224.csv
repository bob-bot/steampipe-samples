34637638,Using old books to fight Web 3.0,2023-02-03T05:59:42Z,lando2,1,false,false,,,,,,"As a skeptical computer scientist I fear we have finally reached the next phase of technology with GPT-3 and stable diffusion, these two technologies in combination with others like deepfake will make for a very different internet, may as well call it what it is, Web 3.0.<p>For all the positive uses of this new tech the repercussions are 10-fold i.e. misinformation (that has conveniently been &#x27;fact-checked&#x27; for us), invasive advertising, lack of privacy and ultimately population control.<p>Any kind of population control starts with limited &#x2F; guided access to knowledge, just take a look at North Korea and how its citizens are brainwashed into believing they are living the high life, relative to the rest of the world.<p>I&#x27;ve always been an avid user of technology, even my major was AI and Data Science in university, but it is time to move on and not allow these technologies into our homes.<p>Home use can simply be using Google Search, browsing YouTube or Instagram, where everything is going to become even more fake than it is now. There are theories suggesting the internet has been dead for a long time already https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true&#x2F;619937&#x2F;.<p>Outside of keeping connected with people (Signal, Whatsapp, etc), there really is no reason to use the internet except to gain knowledge (isn&#x27;t that why the internet was invented in the first place? web 1.0). But we all know most people browse the internet to cater for their addictions, be it news, social media or other forms of internet addictions.<p>Skeptics like myself who don&#x27;t trust the media and government have an extra difficult time finding authorative &amp; unbiased knowledge, but the solution is simple: go back in time.<p>I don&#x27;t mean time travel, I mean books. In particular, books that are pre-2010s, the earlier the better in most subjects.<p>90% of the knowledge people seek isn&#x27;t new, even artificial intelligence content like image edge detection was done way back in the 80s. This is not to say new books are useless, but people undermine old books as if they are obsolete, this is only the case in very specific scientific domains.<p>Now we enter the era where any book, article, news story or even documentary (wont be long now) published after 2023 is either partially or completely generated by algorithms, either spewing propaganda or showing fabricated images and video.<p>I&#x27;d rather read the biased opinion of an author with a ton of life experience, than &#x27;fact-checked&#x27; bullshit online, it won&#x27;t be long before GPT is crowned as the single source of truth because of inevitable &#x27;fact-checking&#x27; abilities.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

What happens to the local commit if the node goes down before that commit is replicated to other nodes?<p>1. Does the DB support multiple write nodes?<p>2. What is the average time it takes for a commit to be available at other nodes?<p>3. Under the hood it works like a blockchain, so what happens if a chain of transactions splits from the main branch? Does the DB client have to retry all those transactions again from the split chain?<p>What is your experience?<p>Also, does anyone know how to add unique constraint on a column in an existing table in SQLite?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
