You send them a welcome notification, and ask them to save the number in their contacts. ONLY ever send notifications from this number<p>3) Every TXT ends with &quot;Suspicious message? reply REPEAT to re-send the last message we sent you&quot;. The user will get used to seeing those notifications from you.<p>4) The recipient can then reply REPEAT and your system will always re-send the most recent message. If a scammer spoofed a message with your sender ID (which is trivial) the REPEAT will go back to your number (it&#x27;s much harder to fraudulently receive messages on a number, than it is to fraudulently send messages from a number) and your system replies with the most recent message. If it differs then the suspicious message can be ignored",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
