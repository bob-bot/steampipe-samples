I confirmed with support that &quot;hmm, I see that your zone seems like being restricted due to 2.8 Limitation on Serving Non-HTML Content, see that there&#x27;s high JSON data transfer&quot;. - which is bit strange as I&#x27;m using workers which have different terms - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20791660 (confirmed by their CTO)...anyways I get it, perhaps I pay too little and should be on enterprise plan already, but when I got approached by Cloudflare sales team I explicitly asked if I can still be on pay as you go&#x2F;self server model and reply was: &quot;Enterprise wise, that&#x27;s up to you and you could likely get away with utilising self-serve as you go, but if you did choose to go enterprise (without R2) I might be able to have something approved in the xx&#x2F;month range.&quot;<p>I would fully understand that I am required to upgrade, but why not sending me an email before shutting down my business completely? I even asked about such scenario on zoom meeting I had with their Sales and they said it will never happen - few weeks forward and here we are...anyways going back to replying to my customers emails regarding service outage.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
