It is packed with a plethora of tools and features, including code generators for services and libraries, a user-friendly CLI for seamless local deployment, Terraform code generation to effortlessly set up the infrastructure on AWS, an NX monorepo solution that keeps all services organized in one place, a Github CI generator that streamlines the deployment process to AWS, and enforces event-driven design through the reliable RabbitMQ message broker. Additionally, strict folder structure is imposed to maintain a clean and well-organized monorepo. The entire project is open-sourced, accompanied by extensive documentation and a demo project to provide a hands-on experience. The purpose of this project is to empower developers by guiding them towards the right approach when building their applications and eliminating the fear of the perceived complexity associated with microservice architecture through the use of powerful code generators.",story,https://github.com/FurlanLuka/microservice-stack,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

One of the biggest challenges I faced was how my profession is divided into different &quot;worlds&quot;. Designers employed at companies, freelancers, academics, creators... All seem to live in different worlds.<p>I developed Design Navigator to help designers choose their world and excel in it.<p>It starts with a simple questionnaire and recommends to you one of four worlds, along with a set of resources to dive deep: employment, freelancing, founder, and creator. Of course, the best way to use it is to check out all four of the &quot;worlds&quot;, get into some of the resources, and then make up your mind.<p>Built using Next.js, TailwindCSS, Vercel, etc. – nothing fancy from a tech standpoint. But I&#x27;m particularly proud of the front end design, wanted to show off some of my skills, and it was received well.<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve learned a lot from HN, and incorporated many YC resources into Design Navigator, especially for the Founder path. While it&#x27;s mainly intended for designers (and particularly UI, UX, web designers, etc.), I&#x27;m sure many of us in tech can find some inspiration in it.

34639991,Ask HN: Which OSS message-passing framework?,2023-02-03T11:53:11Z,rich_sasha,1,false,false,,,,,,"TL;DR: which open-source framework is best suited for facilitating message passing between single client and single server over network, where reliably and correctness are top priority?<p>I have a client connecting to a server. Currently communication is via raw TCP &#x2F; JSON messages. There are known reliability issues, and somewhat hacky suggestions of how to fix this.<p>Instead, I know open-source messaging frameworks exist, like ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, probably others. They all advertise features like low-latency communication, routing, complex messaging topologies etc. These are not my primary concerns - I only have one server and one client. What I care about is<p>- Reliable delivery - messages are not silently dropped, and delivered in correct order<p>- Tolerance to crashes of either client or server (e.g. messages not consumed by the client get seamlessly replayed); e.g. the framework keeps track of messages written and read by client<p>- So long as latency, throughput, memory footprint etc. are not extremely unfavourable, these are non-objectives; typical required message throughput is less than 1 msg&#x2F;sec, with maybe bursts of 10-20 of messages&#x2F;sec for a few seconds.<p>- Ease of integration into a C++ (server) and Python (client) code base, and general ease of maintenance - if the framework is a very complex beast with a steep learning curve, it&#x27;s not necessarily better than hand-crafting the TCP protocol.<p>Basically, I want a queue, into which server can push, client can pop from, and reliability is guaranteed by the framework. Does any OSS framework help my case? I tried googling around, but mostly get SEO garbage articles, or ones that focus on features I don&#x27;t need. I also tried SE, but apparently asking about appropriate software choices is off-topic - go figure...",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
