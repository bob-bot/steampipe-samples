I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was my spotty internet or the browser acting up so I gave Firefox a shot. And behold! Firefox opened it in a jiffy.<p>What impressed me most was that it was able to import saved passwords, bookmarks and websites history from Chrome pretty quickly. Previously, I had imported these to Chromium based web browsers (Brave &amp; Edge) but was afraid that it might be an issue for non-Chromium browser like Firefox, but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn&#x27;t.<p>Some really cool observations in first 30 mins of using it :<p>1. It opens websites really quickly, much faster than Chrome<p>2. All parts feel really customizable. I was able to get rid of the Firefox View tab really easily (I may explore it in the future because it seemed quite interesting). It was also easy enough to customize bookmarks bar to only show up in new tab.<p>3. Extensions ecosystem is thriving . I was glad to find my old favorite: Dark Reader. But I have also found a new favorite - Tab Stash. I also found an extension to download Youtube videos - Video Downloader, something I didn&#x27;t find in Chrome<p>4. Clean look that gets out of your way.<p>I had given Firefox a shot in the past and had found Chrome to be a better performing browser at the time. But this time, Firefox seems to really have clicked with me.<p>I&#x27;d be glad to learn of any other cool features and extensions that y&#x27;all might want to share.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Any code of reasonable complexity in my opinion is much better communicated via detailed and well structured text documentation.<p>But compounding my issues is the fact I&#x27;m autistic and think about everything visually - this includes code which seems to take visual forms in my head. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but I don&#x27;t think with language and when communicating generally I feel as if I have to run my thoughts through a clunky mental transpiler.<p>I&#x27;d really like to be able to host great screenshare sessions where I can go through projects and explain things in a way which is clear and concise, but it seems no matter how hard I try, I can&#x27;t do it.<p>I think I could do better if I had a lot of time to prep. This way I could create documentation with a mixture of text and imagery and go through that instead. But this isn&#x27;t always possible.<p>I know some of you out there are verbally gifted, and I envy you, but for those of you who are not, have you been able to improve your ability to verbally communicate complex systems? Specifically, I&#x27;d appreciate hearing any strategies or processes you implement which improve your ability to communicate.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
