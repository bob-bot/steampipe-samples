I’d like to use C#, but getting a tool chain and development environment is a painful multi-gigabyte commitment. Today, I like Deno for its trivial deployment and smallish (80 MB) footprint (and VS Code+TypeScript is a great development environment, although not very small), but I’m not sure it will be around for the long term. Node is similar, but much more painful to setup.<p>Zig’s compiler (another smallish download) is intriguing, but it’s probably too low level when I only run the programs a few times a year (meaning I don’t want to write low level, fast code—-I’ll trade speed for ease of writing code or small footprint).<p>Tcl&#x2F;Tk seems promising (I’ve heard it can be as small as a few megabytes). Any reason I <i>shouldn’t</i> use Tcl?<p>I’m sure there’s a Lisp option, but I haven’t found one with as small of a footprint as I thought should exist.",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
