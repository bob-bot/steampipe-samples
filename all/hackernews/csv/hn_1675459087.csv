But having seen so many ChatGPT articles got me thinking &quot;nothing would have really stopped my current job from being a very sophisticated scam&quot;.<p>I know this is the best protection, the fact that creating a perfectly fake company is difficult but not impossible at all.<p>Most official info like company name&#x2F;number can just belong to another company, you can register a domain with let&#x27;s encrypt, you can even have a decent recruitment process.<p>Smaller companies tend to have almost no official social presence (I have worked for a couple with very little).<p>At some point they need to ask for money or something and then you will definitely know you have been scammed but by then you might have given notice in your old place and the damage would have been done. They would have also got hold of a lot of private sensitive info like passport numbers, etc.<p>What I would do if I find myself in the market again is to ask to see a demo of the application&#x2F;product (this is something I would encourage people to do regardless). If they are going to go to the extent of creating a real app that is not obviously some templated stuff then it must be almost certainly real.<p>What else could be a good strategy to avoid being scammed while looking for fully remote roles?",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
