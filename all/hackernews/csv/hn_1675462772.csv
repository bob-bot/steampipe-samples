Three I imagine will be popular are:<p>- Pay as you go: Website charges you per interaction, with the some&#x2F;all of that cost going towards their OpenAI API usage<p>- Fixed cost, unlimited usage: Websites charge you once to use the service, and choose a price that reflects the average cost of a user&#x27;s OpenAI api usage<p>- Freemium: Like the above, but the paid users also pay for the limited use that free users use.<p>However, all of these models require the user to submit their billing details to any website they want to interact with, which many users are understandably wary of and adds a lot of friction to trying new services (unless they follow the freemium model, which can be hard to implement and avoid misuse).<p>So, I&#x27;m proposing another option, very similar to how Metamask works (NB: Other than this analogy, my proposal has <i>nothing</i> to do with cryptocurrency - please lower your pitchforks):<p>- You insert your OpenAI API credentials to the Chrome extension
- Any website can request to connect to the extension
- When that request happens, the extension opens a window asking you how many credits or how much money you&#x27;re willing to let the app use.
- Once you&#x27;ve approved that, the app can make OpenAI calls through the extension as a proxy, and the extension will disallow requests after the allowed quota is reached.<p>This would have the advantages of:<p>- Letting the user safely test out AI-powered applications without worrying about the cost
- Making it easier to create web apps that integrate with ChatGPT without having to pay a large upfront cost (let users pay for what they use and nothing more)<p>Other possible features could be:<p>- Grant a daily quota for apps that you keep coming back to
- No-trust mode: See and approve every individual OpenAI request before it is sent
- Audit log: see all requests ever made, with cost and attribution<p>Disadvantages and attack vectors:<p>- Websites could issue requests that break OpenAI rules and this transfers responsibility&#x2F;consequences onto the end-user rather than the operator
- It&#x27;s another service users would need to trust. It could be open-source, but that doesn&#x27;t preclude the possibility that a malicious version would be uploaded to the Chrome Web Store<p>I would love any feedback!",story,,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
