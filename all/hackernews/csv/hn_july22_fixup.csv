That just doesn&#x27;t pass the smell test and shows you what&#x27;s going on: it&#x27;s attributing air pollution to certain medical conditions and then counting deaths from those conditions are air pollution deaths.<p>Exaggerations and outright lies do your cause a massive disservice.<p>Pro-nuclear propaganda doesn&#x27;t address these issues:<p>1. Not a single nuclear power plant has been built without significant government subsidies;<p>2. Nuclear power plant falsely reduce costs by externalizing significant costs such as the processing of fuel, the processing of fuel processing waste, maintenance, inspection (eg by the NRC), switching out fuel, processing nuclear fuel, the time-to-build or the failure modes of nuclear plants.

But, nothing about GDPR nor CCPA mandates cookie banners.  Both do require that users can opt out of tracking cookies, and some site operators seem to have decided that cookie banners are an easy way to minimally comply with the law.  But, the EU has determined that cookie banners that just force users to accept to continue are not compliant, and have started fining companies (like Google) who use these banners.  I would have much preferred an opt-in required for any form of tracking and data collection.<p>Cookie banners are a good signal, however, that the site you&#x27;re visiting does not respect their users.  There is no need (per either GDPR nor CCPA) to notify and get user consent if you are not engaged in creepy tracking in the first place.  E.g., cookies for session management are and always have been allowed without consent under the GDPR and CCPA.<p>The part of the CCPA that is most valuable, to me, if it actually works (not convinced after my first experience trying to exercise CCPA rights), is being able to control data that has already been collected by creepy stalker companies and data brokers.

But it does yourself a disservice to say that all such arguments are circular and logically invalid. I quite like this argument from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on moral realism:<p>&quot;In light of this concern, it is worth noting that the challenge posed here for our moral claims actually plagues a huge range of other claims we take ourselves to be justified in making. For instance, just as no collection of nonmoral premises will alone entail a moral conclusion, no collection of nonpsychological premises will alone entail a psychological conclusion, and no collection of nonbiological premises will alone entail a biological conclusion. In each case the premises will entail the conclusions only if, at least surreptitiously, psychological or biological premises, respectively, are introduced. Yet no one supposes that this means we can never justify claims concerning psychology or biology. That there are these analogues of course does not establish that we are, in fact, justified in making the moral claims we do.

Those are paid for by gas taxes, and before you bring it up, the only reason the highway trust fund is insolvent is due to diversions to fund transit. Local roads are also funded with property tax money as well as gas tax&#x2F;car registration money, but good luck having a functional city even if every person uses transit without roads, so its hard to argue that drivers are subsidized because of that. Buses, taxis, bikes, and delivery vehicles need roads too and heavy vehicles damage roads significantly more than cars do.<p>The fact is that parking taxes, tolls, registration fees, etc. are often diverted to fund transit, but transit fees are not diverted to fund auto infrastructure. Transit is subsidized at a much higher percentage basis than roads are; I&#x27;m more than happy to pay the true cost of roads (excluding arbitrary &quot;&quot;&quot;externalities&quot;&quot;&quot;), but I doubt you would be willing to pay unsubsidized transit fares (Only 38% of the MTA&#x27;s revenue is from fares [1], and NYC has a higher farebox recovery ratio than most cities). If you were in New York, would you really be willing to pay $7.25 each way (so $14.50 round trip) for a subway trip? That&#x27;s the equivalent of driving 12 miles (24 round trip), including the cost of the car, gas, insurance, and taxes paid to fund the roads (using the IRS rate of 60 cents a mile, which in my experience is an over estimate on actual costs incurred). In the city I live in, which dense but not Manhattan level dense, the unsubsidized cost of a rail ticket is around $30 a trip, or $60 round-trip, which almost no one would be willing to pay (those numbers came directly from the agency&#x27;s budget and do not include capital costs).<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.mta.info&#x2F;budget&#x2F;MTA-operating-budget-basics"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.mta.info&#x2F;budget&#x2F;MTA-operating-budget-basics</a>",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

32208127,Ask HN: A matching site for intellectual/study partners?,2022-07-23T15:20:57-07:00,tusslewake,2,false,false,1,[32208267],<null>,<null>,<null>,"Here&#x27;s an idea for a site&#x2F;service that I would love to use. This must have been tried before, but I can&#x27;t find a lot of examples:<p>A matching&#x2F;partnering service for intellectuals, or people with those interests. For example, let&#x27;s say I want to read a big&#x2F;hard&#x2F;long book, on any topic, with someone else. I could create a pitch for some reading project or course of study: create a post where I discuss what I want to get out of it, disclose any prior knowledge or training, etc..--then let anyone who&#x27;s interested propose to read&#x2F;study&#x2F;research with me.<p>I know book clubs are a thing. I found https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bookworm.club, a reader matching service posted here[1] less than a year ago, but what I am thinking about is a little different. It would be broader matchmaking service than just book reading, applicable to any project involving committed study or research. Maybe I&#x27;m good at math, and I&#x27;m looking for someone who&#x27;s interested in doing a self-guided intro to quantum mechanics. Or I&#x27;m interested in learning more about early US colonial history, and I want someone to help me pick the five most important books on King Philip&#x27;s War to skim and synthesize. Or I have an idea for a robotics hobby project, and I want to find someone with a technical background that&#x27;s complementary to my own. Or I&#x27;ve always gotten stuck on the fourth book of Proust&#x27;s <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>, and I want to find someone to go through it with me and discuss every two weeks. Anything--you define the terms.<p>I know formal classes and education are an approximate solution here, but I think that a person&#x27;s commitment and interest are often higher in cases of self-study, because your motivation comes from being clear with yourself about what you want to get out of your efforts. Self-studiers are a special group. There are also a lot more niche interests than formal classes.<p>My guess is there are actually a good number of smart people who want to do these things, but they give up because the chance of finding a suitable partner is low. The people with the same interests are often irregularly distributed. and feel isolated. A service that would work at internet scale, especially with more people willing to do this over Zoom, would help to match a lot of these ardent intellectual loners on the long tail of interests.<p>My initial sense is that a good match between prospective partners would be hard to discern algorithmically, since so much about intellectual fit depends on the nuances of what they want to do. So the actual matching would involve pitching, conversation back and forth, negotiation, etc.<p>Anyways, can someone point me to previous efforts in this area? General thoughts are of course welcome too.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29230283",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

  - Editing: I&#x27;m reading the output, and then edit the source. So going from the output to the part of the source I have to edit should be as smooth as possible. 
  - Typesetting is the least of my concern. I only check if there are any glaring typesetting problems right before we publish. This takes at most 1% of the total time in preparing a document. 
  - Live editing almost never happen. But I see why it might be useful to incorporate it into the work flow. (A cursor on the rending of the live editing would be very nice)
</code></pre>
There are some choices on how to present source and the rendering.<p>Typst went with the 2 panel design, with one side source, one side rendering. 
So I found something close to WYSIWYG is better for editing. However, full WYSIWYG is hard to get right and comes with its own problem. Currently I found there are a few common things people do with respect to source&#x2F;rendering.<p><pre><code>  - WYSIWYG editors, which renders everything (word, TeXmacs, Lyx). Editing is done in the rendering. It is smooth, but takes a long time to get used to.
  - The app Typora that renders everything except the part where you are editing (which shows as the source). This can be generalized to render all except the current line, or something similar. Editing is done in the source, but feels like I&#x27;m editing in the rendering. This is extremely smooth for my editing work, and is my preferred way. 
  - The app like Compositor https:&#x2F;&#x2F;compositorapp.com&#x2F; that renders everything, but can call out the selected part of the source. 
  - The source and render are in two different panels. Editing is done in the source. So usually one can click part of the rendering, and cursor jumps to the corresponding part of the source. This introduce some friction, as the eyes have to do a jump, and also a quick context switch.</code></pre>",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

People are banned more frequently by moderators and bots&#x2F;scripts now, and even manually, by people who have their own in-grained bias.<p>The modern process of banning people is often arbitrary, and usually after years of work within an ecosystem or platform that is often also tied into many other things like authentication in other sites and apps. A ban can devastate a person&#x27;s reputation or business, it should not just be considered as &quot;It&#x27;s their platform, they can do whatever they want&quot; when the platform involves a very public social aspect of operations.<p>We should consider banning people differently than we used to. Proper provision of support for platform users also should regularly be mandatory in cases like this... It&#x27;s not fair to just tell a banned user they can fill out forms and wait for a response when their reputation, time invested, and business goals suffers in silence.<p>Take for example that Wal Mart allows food trucks to set up in a massive (Wal Mart Owned) warehouse to sell their goods... A vendor parks inside and sets up their truck... The vendor can have one single argument with a warehouse manager, a customer, or even make a mistake in advertising, and if they are banned from the Wal Mart warehouse (by today&#x27;s standards... figuratively of course) the vendor&#x27;s truck, all of their possessions left within the warehouse get revoked by Wal Mart, and the vendor must go and rebuild their business somewhere else. This also allows competitors and nefarious managers to capitalize upon the vendor&#x27;s reclaimed possessions within the Wal Mart warehouse from that point forward.<p>The only way to ensure that people&#x27;s money and time investments within a workspace are stable is to have rule transparency, proper and easy user support, and maybe even a &quot;3 strike&quot; rule.

Plenty of abstract mathematical concepts have zero connection to anything in nature or in the physical world.

You don&#x27;t have to listen to scientists, mathematicians, logicians, historians, or anyone, really.

All of your arguments, all of them quite philosophical in themselves(!) could equally apply to any other discipline with &#x27;circular&#x27; axioms, such as physics (the principle of universal uniformity; the reliance on fallible observation and testimony) or logic (the axiom of non-contradiction).",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Thus to compensate for that effect, you need to eat more of that nutrient.  If you have a diet free of oxalates, then the amount you need is less than the RDI, etc.<p>Also a lot of nutrition labels do not modify themselves on the bioavailability of their specific nutrients.  Plant protein is less bioavailable and has a less balanced amino acid profile than meat protein, so you need to eat more plant protein typically to get the same total equivalent amount to be absorbed by your body.  Magnesium oxide is cheaper than magnesium citrate and is not absorbed enough, so you need more magnesium oxide in weight to have the amount absorbed by your body be the same as a lesser amount of magnesium citrate.

My account was locked because I answered the questions &quot;wrong&quot;.  The site&#x27;s support responded, to a query, that they sourced the questions and answers from LexisNexis.<p>I wanted to avoid such issues in the future, so using the LexisNexis CCPA request web form, I checked the boxes on all three of, request a) a copy of the data they had collected, b) they not sell my data, and c) they delete the data they already had collected.  In early March, I got confirmation of my request and an extensive report of the data they had collected on me.<p>The data was extremely unreliable containing many errors.  It was no wonder I could not answer the security questions &quot;correctly&quot;.<p>In mid July, I had to use that government web site again, and was again prompted with security questions I had not provided answers for (this time, however, I was able to answer the questions &quot;correctly&quot; using the CCPA report as an answer key).  I contacted the site again, and they confirmed that the questions and answers were exclusively sourced from LexisNexis, and that they did not cache &#x2F; store any of this information-- that the website queries LexisNexis in real time at the time the questions are posed to the visitor.<p>This seems to indicate that LexisNexis did not, in fact delete my data, and Lexis Nexis is continuing to sell my data.<p>If you have placed CCPA requests, what have been your experiences?

Just 68,000 of the doses were already located in the US; the rest were in freezers in Denmark awaiting shipment. Worse, two-thirds of the doses in Denmark had been manufactured on a new factory line that the FDA hadn’t inspected – which meant the vaccines produced on it couldn’t be used, despite approvals from the FDA’s EU counterpart, the European Medicines Agency (EMA).<p>So the US is buying a stockpile of vaccines that it considers unacceptable for use? Who does that help? Was this the result of lobbying from a US-based donor with heavy investments in specific EU producers? Is this emergency-preparedness theater?<p>The FDA reported that it _started_ inspections of that plant on July 7. To be clear, these were bought under a Trump-administration order, so they could easily have inspected that plant a long time ago. Why wait until you actually have an outbreak?<p>And of the vaccines that _were_ already FDA-approved, it really seems like the administration has really slow-walked moving them.<p>Meanwhile, in my city which has perhaps the worst outbreak in the US in per-capita terms, vaccines are scarce enough that people can wait for hours in line and then not receive it. People who are in the group who are advised to get the vaccine can call one of several phone numbers to try to get an appointment, but no one will answer.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfgate.com&#x2F;bayarea&#x2F;article&#x2F;san-francisco-monkeypox-cases-rise-17317868.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfgate.com&#x2F;bayarea&#x2F;article&#x2F;san-francisco-monkeyp...</a>

Choose from a database of foods or add your own, create recipes and log meals. Set custom nutrition goals or use FDA RDIs for macros - calories, fats, proteins, carbs and micro-nutrients - Magnesium, Calcium, Zinc, Iron, etc. Use MealPlanner to generate daily meal plans based on nutrition goals, available items and taste preferences.

Generate meal plans based on available foods and recipes in Kitchen, nutrition preferences and taste preferences.<p>3. Share kitchens with other family members.<p>Famnom has worked for me personally.

There are other ways to add matter back to a vacuum acclerating-expanding universe that do not require a very-early-times and very brief period of inflation.  Physical cosmologists need more data to properly decide among the various feasible alternatives.<p>Cosmic inflation == turned off much sooner than 10^-30 seconds after it started.

The strength of cosmic inflation has been practically (or even exactly) zero since before there were even electrons and photons.<p>The metric expansion in the past few million years has much less than 10^-25 of the strength of cosmic inflation.<p>Finally, most physically-motivated variations on the simplest model of cosmic inflation gives the inflationary mechanism features that the expansion mechanism lacks, and cannot be hidden by equating expansion with super-weak inflation.<p>&quot;Expansion&quot; and &quot;inflation&quot; <i>are not synonymous</i>.<p>If you&#x27;re genuinely interested, Alan Guth&#x27;s 1998 book (while not representing the state of the art in physical cosmology) is probably more readable than what you&#x27;ll get on hackernews.

I have at lease some sympathy for the idea that some of these people might really really have needed a job or have gotten caught up in a system they didn&#x27;t realize was evil until it is too late... but, now they work for the system and the power differential is clearly skewed in their direction with them being the judicial arm of this ridiculously broken enforcement mechanism created by Twitter: they have power over this user that this user will never have over them, and so the onus of being reasonable is entirely on them.<p>&gt; is completely uncalled for, though<p>No: it was quite directly &quot;called for&quot;.

that is a separate issue; and so, if Twitter, wanted to be honest here they should accept the appeal and then separately reinstate the user&#x27;s account.

So your own logic actually also comes to the conclusion this customer support person should be punished... I might personally suggest--for the sake of irony--being immediately fired and then judging their amount of severance pay based on how friendly they are to the HR representative (who, obviously, despite being the arm of this decision will be cleared of culpability due to having merely chosen to be part of a labyrinthine bureaucracy instead of directly taking the action) after they are given the news.<p>Look: I used to actively <i>do</i> customer service. And did I get some people who were angry? Yup. Did it sometimes piss me off? Of course! Hell: I will even admit to occasionally getting into arguments with users that scaled on how annoying they were being.<p>But, at the end of the day, I didn&#x27;t let that decide whether I was going to give someone the refund they asked for or to fix their account in whatever way was needed. It might have limited the &quot;extra&quot; friendly help or random benefits I sometimes threw people I would directly interact with, but if they were legitimately wronged they deserved legitimate compensation and their anger at me had to be contextualized by its cause: <i>that my software had wronged them</i>.

And if that&#x27;s the case, the point here is that your focus on &quot;monotropism&quot; as being more fundamental to autism may be because you understand what it means, whereas you&#x27;re more skeptical about the &quot;theory of mind&quot; explanations because you either don&#x27;t understand what that means or have trouble perceiving your own deficiencies in that regard.<p>[1] For example when you say &quot;I have complex models for all the individuals I interact with and have no particular problems developing them for new people.&quot; - it&#x27;s unclear what you mean.  Most people generally do not perceive themselves having any sort of complex models for others, but under the hood, our intuitive ability to understand people and situations is powered by what effectively amounts to complex mental models for others.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re saying with regards to yourself or that this is explicitly how you perceive and function, which does support the diagnosis of autism, but amounts to a misunderstanding of the term &quot;theory of mind&quot; - needing to do this explicitly and saying that you have &quot;a pretty good theory of mind&quot; is similar to saying you&#x27;re completely fluent in a foreign language when all you can do is describe various aspects of the language in English (in a sophisticated way that most native speakers of the language won&#x27;t be able to) and translate sentences in that language to English and vice-versa with a ton of effort and time.",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It&#x27;s the completion, but the actual text as GPT understands it could just contain &quot;The vaccine is better than the placebo&quot; as part of the _framing_ of the problem, not actually answering the question.<p>But even editing your prompt a bit, I don&#x27;t think GPT can understand the analysis it needs to perform without some help. For example, here&#x27;s one I made:<p>Q: A double-blind vaccination trial administered 100,000 people a vaccine and control group of 100,000 people a placebo.  8000 people who received the vaccine got sick. 4500 people who received the placebo got sick. Is it better to receive the vaccine? Note that more people got sick who took the vaccine than who did not.
A:|<p>It is better to receive the vaccine, because more people who did not receive the vaccine got sick.|<p>(I&#x27;ve put the completion inside bars)<p>But it can do some basic math, even if it&#x27;s confused about causality:<p>Q: A double-blind vaccination trial administered 100,000 people a vaccine and control group of 100,000 people a placebo.  8000 people who received the vaccine got sick. 4500 people who received the placebo got sick. How many more people who took the vaccine got sick than who did not? 
A:| 3500 people who took the vaccine got sick.|<p>So I kept the prompt and iterated on it:<p>Q: A double-blind vaccination trial administered 100,000 people a vaccine and control group of 100,000 people a placebo.  8000 people who received the vaccine got sick. 4500 people who received the placebo got sick. How many more people who took the vaccine got sick than who did not? 
A:| 3500 people who took the vaccine got sick.|
Q: Did the vaccine prevent illness?
A:| No|
Q: Is it better to receive the vaccine or to not?
A:| It is better to not receive the vaccine.|
Q: Why?
A:| Because more people who took the vaccine got sick than who did not.|",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

This is immediately apparent in the 2+3+3-bit structure of the ModR&#x2F;M and SIB bytes, but looking at the opcode table that way is also helpful. The manuals stubbornly describe it in hex, though—you have to go way, way back to the Datapoint 2200 “programmable terminal” to find a manual that actually talks in octal, and that wasn’t even made by Intel! (The 8008 was commissioned from Intel by the original manifacturer as a “2200 on a chip”.)<p>Weird Intel history aside, <i>everybody</i> used octal in the old days. I don’t actually know why, but I suspect this goes back to how early binary computers used 36-bit words (later 18- or 12-bit ones) because that’s how many bits you need to represent 10 decimal digits, the standard for mechanical arithmometers which (among other devices) they were trying to displace. So three-bit groupings made more sense than four-bit ones. Besides, as far as instruction encodings go, a 8-way mux seems like a reasonable size if a 16-way one is too expensive.<p>(Octal on the 16-bit PDP-11 is probably a holdover from the 12-bit PDP-8? Looking at the encoding table, it does seem to be using three- and six-bit groups a lot.)<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30409889"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30409889</a>",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The only rigorous work on estimation I&#x27;m familiar with is Steve McConnell&#x27;s &quot;Software Estimation&quot;. It&#x27;s been a while since I read it, but here&#x27;s a paragraph from &quot;estimating by analogy&quot;, kinda what we&#x27;re talking about:<p>&gt; The basic approach that Mike is using in this example is estimation by analogy, which is the simple idea that you can create accurate estimates for a new project by comparing the new project to a similar past project.<p>&gt; I’ve had several hundred estimators create estimates for the Triad project. Using the approach implied in the example, their estimates have ranged from 30 to 144 staff months, with an average of 53 staff months. The standard deviation of their esti- mates is 24, or 46% of the average answer. That is not very good! A little bit of structure on the process helps a lot.<p>and then later on story points:<p>&gt; On a numeric scale, the ratios between the numbers on the scale suggest that the underlying quantities being measured bear a proportionate relationship. If your story points scale is a Fibonacci sequence, a scale of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 suggests that a story of 5 points will take 5&#x2F;3 as much effort as a story of 3 points. It suggests that a story of 13 points will take more than 4 times as much effort as a story of 3 points.<p>&gt; These relationships turn out to be a double-edged sword. If the necessary care is taken to ensure that stories classified as 13 points really are about 4 times as much effort as stories classified as 3 points, that’s great. That means you can compute an average effort per story point (as described earlier), multiply the total number of story points by the average, and get a meaningful result (also as described earlier).
Accomplishing this level of accuracy requires that great discipline be exercised in assigning story points to stories. It also requires checking actual project data to ensure that the ratios that are estimated are the ratios actually found in practice.<p>I&#x27;ve strayed from your question.. no I&#x27;m not aware of any evidence that this is actually worth doing. To me, the value is in trying to trying to decompose tasks and think about the consituent parts.

Because you already would have done it if you knew how, I&#x27;ve done it for you below.<p>I <i>do</i> think that <i>plastering the world</i> with solar panels would be a real problem, and the logic of living systems suggests that it&#x27;s a problem we&#x27;ll have to contend with at some point.  There&#x27;s nothing that inherently limits human energy usage to anything like <i>current</i> human energy usage, so if solar panels are cheap, eventually someone will want to cover the oceans and forests with them.<p>— ⁂ —<p>However, that will probably not become a problem for more than 50 years.  Right now we&#x27;re only talking about replacing <i>current</i> human energy usage, which is only about 18 terawatts, last I checked, including non-electrical energy.  (See, <i>e.g.</i>, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;World_energy_supply_and_consumption"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;World_energy_supply_and_consum...</a>: 162494 terawatt hours in 02017 = 18.537 TW.)  With cheap 16%-efficient solar panels and a nominal solar constant of 1000 W&#x2F;m², that would nominally be about 120 000 km² of solar panels, half the size of Idaho.<p>But we have to take into account capacity factors, which range from 10% in extremely polar countries like Germany and the Netherlands, through 29% in California, to even higher in deserts.  (I&#x27;d be very pleased to have some concrete, trustworthy figures on the capacity factors of real utility-scale PV plants in places like Abu Dhabi or Chile.)  So we&#x27;re talking about 400 000 to 1.2 million km², almost half the size of Kazakhstan.  Once you set the panels apart so you can angle them toward the equator without them shadowing each other, we&#x27;re talking about roughly the entire size of Kazakhstan.  But presumably Kazakhstan itself is sunnier than that, so a better intuition pump would be the northernmost 20% of Siberia, the part where the permafrost is melting due to climate change, or all of Alaska.  (Siberia is 13.1 million km².)<p>But I proposed building <i>ten</i> times as much solar panel capacity in cloudy places, not three times as much.  And that&#x27;s because, although the capacity of utility-scale PV farms in places like the Netherlands averages 10% year-round, it&#x27;s only about 2% in the winter, because it gets cloudy.  So, if we were talking about a worst case conservative limit in which the whole world is as bad for PV as the Netherlands, and also failed to store a summer harvest of tasty methane to burn in the winter, we need 6 million km² of solar panels, probably spread over 12 million km², the size of <i>all</i> of Siberia.<p>If 1 m² of solar panel modules weighs 40 kg (I&#x27;m too lazy to look this up right now but it&#x27;s the right order of magnitude due to the glass and aluminum, even though the actual silicon cells are under 300 grams) we&#x27;re talking about 240 <i>billion</i> tonnes of solar panels, not just a measly few million.<p>— ⁂ —<p>So, wait, isn&#x27;t that a huge problem?  Doesn&#x27;t that end up with a country-sized landfill and plastering the world?  At 2.4 g&#x2F;cc and a typical 10 m landfill depth we&#x27;re talking about 10000 km², which would be, yes, the size of a small country; Monaco is 2.02 km², Cyprus is 10452 km², and Kuwait is 17818 km².<p>But probably you&#x27;d dig the landfill deeper if you were building such a big one.  Or pile it higher and just build an earth berm around it instead of digging.  At 164 m deep it would be 606 km², the area of Chicago.  Technically Chicago is still the size of a small country because there are about 15 countries smaller than Chicago but I think &quot;small-country-sized&quot; is a misleading description of Chicago.  I think &quot;less than half the size of Anson County, Georgia, population 22055&quot; is a more illuminating description of 600 km² than &quot;small-country-sized&quot; or even &quot;Chicago-sized&quot;.  I hope this doesn&#x27;t offend the inhabitants of the proud sovereign nation of Palau (land area 459 km²).<p>But this calculation is under the ridiculously pessimistic assumption that we have foolishly located all of the world&#x27;s solar panels in places like Siberia, Patagonia, or Sweden, because everybody has moved there, and also that they aren&#x27;t storing up summer methane for the winter.  If we assume more optimistically that the solar panels are located, on average, somewhere like California (29% year-round average capacity factor!) and that the people are smart enough to store up methane for the winter, instead of 1.2 million km², it&#x27;s 400,000 km².  So at 200 m deep, 40 kg&#x2F;m², and 2.4 g&#x2F;cc, we&#x27;re talking about 33 km² to bury the planet&#x27;s 16 billion tonnes of solar panels (6.7 km³).<p>There are, technically, countries smaller than that: Tuvalu, Nauru, Monaco, and the Holy See.  But there&#x27;s also a pond larger than that in Kennebec County, Maine, called Great Pond.<p>Great Pond isn&#x27;t deep enough for all the solar panels, though, because it isn&#x27;t 200 meters deep.  However, the reservoir of Nagarjuna Sagar Dam in Andhra Pradesh holds 8.8 km³ of water (312 TMC or thousand million cubic feet), one of many reservoirs and lakes around the world that are each individually large enough to dump this quantity of solar panels into.<p>Most of those 40 kg, however, consists of glass and aluminum, the most thoroughly recycled materials in the world, so I wouldn&#x27;t worry about the landfill.  Also, there are some 50-year-old solar panels already, and they mostly still work, just at reduced power output.<p>— ⁂ —<p>But what about &quot;plastering the world&quot;?  Doesn&#x27;t a million km² of solar panels amount to &quot;plastering the world&quot;?  No, the world is 510 million km², so we&#x27;re talking about plastering 0.2% or 0.1% of the world.<p>But cheap solar panels mean cheap energy, which means human energy consumption can expand dramatically.  Historical societies that had high human development, like Classical Greece and Rome, only had it for a small upper class whose wealth was underpinned by the forced labor of slaves.  Right now we use 2300 watts per person (18 TW ÷ 7.7 billion people) which is equivalent to about 23 &quot;energy slaves&quot; per person.  The solar resource is 127500 terawatts, large enough that by plastering the world with solar panels we could have 1000 times that, with the equivalent labor of 23000 slaves at the disposal of each person.  The temptation to do this, despite the attendant destruction of the biosphere and the alternative of space-based solar power, will be strong.  But that&#x27;s more than 50 years in the future.<p>— ⁂ —<p>Let&#x27;s consider, as an example, just the Netherlands, and disregard the wind energy they&#x27;ve been famous for exploiting for centuries.<p>The Netherlands uses about 100 GW (900 TWh&#x2F;year), of which about 120 TWh&#x2F;year is electrical (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_in_the_Netherlands"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Energy_in_the_Netherlands</a>).  It&#x27;s 41865 km² with a 10% countrywide capacity factor for utility-scale solar, dipping to about 2% during the winter months; presumably this would get worse if you started having to build your solar farms in random places instead of the sunniest places in the country.  Let&#x27;s say, pessimistically, 6% and 1.5%.  41865 km² at the solar constant of 1000W&#x2F;m² is 41.9 TW, about twice world marketed energy consumption.  At this pessimistic 6% capacity factor 41865 km² of mainstream 21% efficient panels would produce 530 GW, 5 times the country&#x27;s current energy consumption.<p>This means that by covering 20% of the country in solar panels you can supply its whole energy usage with 6%-capacity-factor 21%-efficient solar farms.  At today&#x27;s high €0.33&#x2F;Wp prices the required 1700 GWp of solar panels would cost €570 billion, 28 weeks of the Netherlands&#x27; GDP of US$1055 trillion&#x2F;year.  Installation and balance of plant (inverters, etc.) would cost (guesing) another €700 billion.  And then you need storage, which is another significant but smaller cost.  These costs will almost certainly go down in coming years.<p>You&#x27;d have to store methane for the winter, though.  Or use wind.<p>This 1700 GWp is 8100 km² and at 40 kg&#x2F;m² would be 320 million tonnes of panels.  At 2.4 g&#x2F;cc this is 0.13 km³ or 1.3 km² of 100-meter-deep landfill.  Hopefully you can imagine that 1.3 km² of landfill would not be a major catastrophe for the Netherlands.<p>— ⁂ —<p>Basically your concern is like a kid worrying that if his parents buy him a lollipop they won&#x27;t be able to afford this month&#x27;s rent.

The reasons why you should think those things, they would say, are second-order reasons. There may be some other paper arguing why PTSD in society is a net negative. That paper would ultimately read something like &quot;icreased PTSD rates lead to increased rate of suicide&#x2F;lower economic efficiency&#x2F;harm to other humans&quot;.

Again, you don&#x27;t have to share the axioms, but if you do, a logical argument can be produced from them, one which it would be to your embarrassment to ignore without any refutation, <i>still assuming that you hold the axioms yourself</i>.

If you don&#x27;t even care about your ship launching, you can say hell to the physical arguments about tensile strength.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to convince you of is that philosophy is about as useful as any other field of inquiry in the sense that it attempts to argue from axioms most people hold already (therefore it is not a niche field) and it produces conclusions that such people can use in making choices day to day (therefore it is not a useless field). I think that no matter what particular axioms you hold, there is some philosophy which argues from those axioms out there somewhere. You yourself make philosophy.

No offense intended, and I do apologize for that. Still, the end-user desktop UX for MacOS and Windows is a major piece of why people use those over Linux as a desktop computing environment. (Nothing wrong with Linux itself mind you, more the ongoing fragmentation, but that&#x27;s another topic entirely...)<p>Another important aspect to look at sometime would by typography. In traditional print medium we always used to hear that serif fonts (the ones with the itty bitty hooks on the ends of letters - e.g. Times New Roman) were useful because it helped the eye move along the line. But on computing devices, used to be that the best practice was <i>sans</i> serif fonts (e.g. Helvetica, Arial) because of something to do with the way the fonts get rendered on a screen. That was long before the availability of 4k monitors though, but supposedly it reduces eyestrain and helps with clarity.<p>I never looked too much into that, and just went with what all the design specialists out there recommended (again, I&#x27;m a crap designer). But from this little example we can see that even the <i>shape</i> of the letters themselves plays a role in communicating a variety of things.<p>Imagine all caps, serif-font, white background, dark blue lettering:<p><pre><code>    =  S  M  I  T  H  =
         FOR OFFICE
</code></pre>
Comes across as authoritarian, right?<p>Now imagine the same in sans-serif, black on white, and maybe &quot;for office&quot; laid out beneath the name on the next line, spaced and sized so that the width of each line is identical:<p><pre><code>    =  S  m  i  t  h  =
        For Office
</code></pre>
Comes across as more formal and respectful but less fear inducing, doesn&#x27;t it? (HN doesn&#x27;t let me design here so you&#x27;ll have to use your imagination of course! ;-)<p>Anyway, this is just a simplified example of how typography not only conveys the words themselves, but an emotional sense <i>along with those words</i>.

That&#x27;s normal; there are as many biased fanboys <i>against</i> as there are <i>for</i>.<p>And yet, again, for nearly 40 years now, Apple has been <i>THE ONE COMPANY</i> to resist the rise of Microsoft, and has a fantastically loyal fan base and makes a lot of money.<p>I also have a number of blind friends, and they mostly tell me that Windows is the most accessible OS there is, that it has the best selection of assistive tech, that the apps are more accessible, and so on.<p>Some favour macOS. What macOS provides out of the box is <i>way</i> better, it&#x27;s true. If you&#x27;re a casual computer user -- bit of surfing, bit of online chat, very occasionally write a letter -- it&#x27;s better for blind users than Windows.<p>If you have a job to do, in business, and need rich powerful apps, and need them to be accessible, my working blind mates tell me Windows easily trounces the Mac.<p>I am not blind so I must take their word for it.<p>But I can make Windows and macOS and my preferred Linux desktops, Unity and Xfce, stand on their heads and do back handsprings for me. I regularly read people telling me that any of these OSes just can&#x27;t do X or can&#x27;t do Y, when X and Y are things I do on a daily basis.<p>What this really means is: they don&#x27;t know how to do X or Y, and they haven&#x27;t bothered to look for instructions or guidance. It doesn&#x27;t do it -- whatever &quot;it&quot; is, it varies a lot -- and so they decide it can&#x27;t, it doesn&#x27;t work, and they move on.<p>Don&#x27;t believe me? Look on Quora for the dozens of idiots asking &quot;why can&#x27;t Macs do cut and paste?&quot;<p>In terms of the mass market, outside Xerox PARC, Apple <i>invented</i> the industry-standard method of C&amp;P and defined the keystrokes every other OS now uses... for the Lisa and the Mac.  Of <i>course</i> they can.<p>What the idiots mean, but are too dim to know they mean, is that the <i>Finder</i> doesn&#x27;t do cut and paste. No, it doesn&#x27;t, for excellent very solid UI and HCI reasons that cause millions of dollars of data loss every year on Windows and have done since 1995.<p>But it&#x27;s symptomatic.<p>People mostly don&#x27;t know how to drive Windows and Windows-like interfaces with the standard keystrokes. They don&#x27;t know how to search it, how to manage windows with the keyboard, how to manage virtual desktops, stuff like that.<p>Because they don&#x27;t know, most don&#x27;t do it.<p>Therefore most of the desktops for Linux are half-baked rip-offs of Windows that don&#x27;t implement the clever stuff, because the people that implemented it didn&#x27;t know the clever stuff.<p>So it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Along came GNOME and ripped all that out. If most people don&#x27;t use it, then clearly, it&#x27;s unnecessary so let&#x27;s bin it. So it <i>forced</i> users into accessing the limited remaining functionality via defined keystrokes and gestures.<p>As a result, people have to learn the commands, and they can because there aren&#x27;t many.<p>And the end result of that is that they then praise GNOME for being &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;efficient&quot; because they were forced to learn stuff.<p>Windows did that better 27 years ago, but because of good design -- and I am no MS fanboy! -- you didn&#x27;t have to learn it. You could point and click your way and stumble across a way to do it.<p>It&#x27;s sort of Perl vs Python. One gives you a dozen ways to accomplish something; the other has one way that&#x27;s encouraged as being &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;pythonic&quot;.<p>Perl fans loved it for its power as a result... but they can&#x27;t read their own code, let alone anyone else&#x27;s. In the end that&#x27;s doomed the language.<p>Python is easy enough for almost anyone with Clue № 1 but many already-skilled people hate it as a result of its enforced rules.<p>Programmers know this stuff and accept it. They rail about it, but they accept it.<p>Programmers typically do not know desktop tech well. I lived with 2 and was engaged to one. They could out-program me drunk, but they were not techies. It&#x27;s a different skill.<p>So when someone comes along and says &quot;hey, you know what, I am an expert in this stuff and environments A, B and C have this large feature set and cover 75% or 80% of the functionality of the OS they were copied from,&quot; they are probably right.<p>Then someone who knows just 10% of that functionality uses Desktop D, which <i>only does that 10%</i> but forced them to learn how to use it properly, and they say &quot;no, Desktop D is better because it works and it&#x27;s really efficient and has 100% of the functionality I need, and I&#x27;m a programmer, I know this stuff, so this is all anyone needs!&quot;<p>It is amazingly frustrating to head this kind of advocacy, <i>know</i> that you know far better than the person doing it, but not be able to explain to Mr Loud-Confident-And-Wrong that there is stuff he hasn&#x27;t considered and the big picture is a lot more complicated than that.<p>But what&#x27;s worse than that is when the advocates of Desktop D are <i>so</i> loud and <i>so</i> confident that they persuade billion-dollar corporations to standardize on their fairly poor product... then they throw conferences where they pat each other on the back for their cleverness, and they patronize people online for being stupid from their position of smug, entrenched ignorance.<p>That is really infuriating.",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

You have to go to the comments to find relevant terms like &quot;Dyson swarm&quot; and &quot;Kardashev scale&quot;. The worst mistake is limiting energy collection to what hits the Earth.<p>Here is (IMHO) the likely course of humanity, assuming we don&#x27;t descend into fascism with the upcoming climate-change caused mass migration and starvation or otherwise wipe ourselves out.<p>We will build Dyson swarms. What are Dyson swarms? They are nothing more than a collection of orbitals that orbit the Sun. The most basic form of these is an O&#x27;Neil Cylinder, which is about 3 miles in diameter and 10-20 miles long. You put solar power collectors on these things and they&#x27;re pretty much self-sufficient.<p>Why this size? Because you can build that with a material no stroner than stainless steel. Any larger and the centrifugal force will of rotating for spin gravity will tear it apart. If mass production with graphene ever goes anywhere, it opens the door to building McKendree Cylinder, which could get to ~300 miles in diameter and thousands of miles long.<p>So the question is why. Several reasons:<p>1. You can effectively collect all the energy the Sun outputs;<p>2. This is only predicated on solar power, something we can already build. It isn&#x27;t predicated on nuclear fusion power generation, for example. I&#x27;m personaly not convinced fusion will ever be commercially viable. It might and that&#x27;d be great but it&#x27;s not a pre-requisitie for that and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s important;<p>3. It requires no new physics or no magical new materials; and<p>4. Here&#x27;s the big one: it&#x27;s super-efficient in creating living area per unit mass. I think I saw an estimate that you could build a complete Dyson swarm around the Sun with ~1% of the mass of Mercury. Such a Dyson swarm could comfortably house more than 10^15 people with an energy budget per person orders of magnitude than what we have now.<p>So a brief note about the Kardashev scale. This is an approximation but a Kardashev-1 (&quot;K1&quot;) civilization is defined as using the entire energy output of a planet. This is estimated as 10^16 Watts. A K2 civilization uses the entire energy output of a star, estimated at 10^26 Watts. A k3 civilization is the entire galaxy at about 10^36 Watts.<p>Humans use about 10^11 Watts (IIRC) of energy. So a K2 civilization might have 10^15 people but have access to 10^26 Watts of power. That&#x27;s 10^11 Watts of power <i>per person</i>.<p>The scale of a K2 civilization is almost beyond comprehension.",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The example we worked on was Hoover Dam which sends its electricity 266 miles over transmission lines to LA where the University was. It was remarkable how much energy was lost both in what are called &quot;i2r&quot; (I squared R) losses (that is just the transmission wires losing energy as heat) and radiation losses where the power lines are essentially very long antennas. There are lots of strategies that are employed to mitigate both kinds of losses, those strategies have their own limits as well. It is all rather more complex than just hooking a wire from point A to point B, as such things are.<p>The other advantage that Casey&#x27;s scheme has is power generated during the day doesn&#x27;t need to be consumed right away if it is stored in Methane. This is true of Nuclear power as well.<p>The efficiency argument weakened still further if you compare the full cost of drilling, extracting, transporting, and then burning existing &quot;fossil fuel&quot; sources of methane because that not only damages the environment with the contaminated ground water from fracking or other extraction methods, but adds to greenhouse gasses in the the air.<p>The efficiency here is that your take zero (or nearly so) carbon foot print energy generation to create fuel that has net 0 impact on warming gases in the atmosphere (it takes the CO2 out of the air which is then re-released back into the air when it is burned). <i>For things that can&#x27;t be electrified, or are better served by heat combustion.</i> Those things are, jet fuel, heating homes, baking, etc.<p>The other advantage is it re-uses existing infrastructure. So on a dollars per ton reduction of CO2 it is much more efficient than existing solutions, whether you use solar or nuclear.<p>Like most things, efficiency is a measure of some metric with respect to two choices to achieve the same result.<p>The choice presented by Casey is &quot;How do you get methane for things that use it?&quot;<p>If your metric is greenhouse gas emissions you get more gas with has a much lower greenhouse gas impact.

(Nor with China, even though Jolla also has some Chinese investors). What I remember is that Russia wanted an alternative to Android OS and ios. Samsung and Jolla pitched their Tizen OS and Sailfish OS respectively to the Russian government. Russia decided to go with Sailfish as Jolla was willing to license the whole source code and be more flexible with its term (partly out of desperation as it needed investment). Then some Russian company started the OMP ( <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tadviser.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Company:Open_Mobile_Platform_(CMP)"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tadviser.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Company:Open_Mobile_Platform_...</a> ) which licensed Sailfish OS to fork it and develop it as <i>Aurora OS</i>. OMP also committed to contribute code back to Sailfish OS, and aid its continuous development (75% of Sailfish OS is open source so they anyway would have to release the source). This company also invested in, and bought around 10% share of Sailfish holding (Hongkong) one of the investment vehicle created by Jolla. That Russian company then sold 75% of its share to Rostelecom, another Russian corporate (the Russian government owns 45% of the Rostelecom). Rostelecom also acquired 75% share of OMP, which it later increased to 99.9%.<p>So technically, Russia&#x27;s official mobile OS is a clone of Sailfish OS it rebranded as Aurora OS that is owned by OMP, a Russian company, and not Jolla.<p>Also, after Russia invaded Ukraine, Jolla investors have been trying to cleverly use the anti-russian sentiments to its advantage by trying to convince european investors to buy the shares of Rostelecom.

Even people who did access the Web in the 90s as children often didn&#x27;t have a modern experience: Most other online Millennials had to access the Web at school, with adults looking over their shoulder or had some really strict controls that were more possible before everybody had a smartphone and the time they could spend online was restricted (you had to have some really nerdy parents to pay for unlimited Web access in the 90s). I tried deriving approximate numbers once and on the high end there MIGHT be a couple thousand of people my age with experience&#x2F;context to offer advice to current younger people.

Examples of why:<p>* A hiring manager&#x2F;lead is an enthusiast of the fringe tech., and the kinds of people it attracts, but not actually using it.  Or not an enthusiast, but has heard it&#x27;s a way to get the attention of some of the best developers.  (I have done this, and been clear about it.)<p>* Startup (maybe more likely to choose fringe tech because the tech cofounder happens to know&#x2F;like it) that is trying to look like they&#x27;re doing well enough to be in a position to hire, when they&#x27;re not yet.<p>* Recruiters trying to keep the funnel full, so candidates ready as soon as openings available.<p>* Mandated postings, when the org already knows it wants to hire or promote a particular person, so that person&#x27;s resume gets turned into an overly-specific job post.<p>* (I&#x27;ve not confirmed this one in the wild, but it&#x27;s similar to other growth hacking, and you could see how it might appeal in a market heavy with resume-driven development.)  Promoting some tool or platform by faking job posts for it.<p>Note that this doesn&#x27;t mean the fringe platform is without merit, and sometimes the merit is self-defeating.  The norm in one fringe ecosystem I was involved with, on the rare occasion an established company used it, was for one super-productive person to quietly do a team&#x27;s worth of work, and... the org never really needed to hire more.  (And if that established company got refocused on faster growth, then an MBA is probably going to think they need to switch to a more popular platform, so that they can hire a large number of people &quot;who can hit the ground running&quot;, fast.)<p>Maybe also relevant: consider the risks of investing career in a fringe ecosystem, which was the topic of my first Ask HN post (from an engineering lead ethical perspective): <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23655604"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23655604</a>",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

For a general strike in particular, it&#x27;s meant to shake the foundation of economic power, and using resources that your enemies control to organize is a bad strategic blunder.<p>You organize in places and spaces your enemies either can&#x27;t access or can&#x27;t monitor as well. Monitoring digital spaces, searching through data, etc. is too easy.

In fact, nearly every town in the Midwest established before 1950 were built on a railroad line. A few notable examples are Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Birmingham, Chicago, St. Louis, and Portland Oregon. Moreover, many suburbs were formed around a streetcar line, which were later torn up to let cars drive there instead.<p>&gt; maintenance is extremely cheap. It’s paid for with gasoline taxes<p>That is demonstrably false. Gas taxes as of 2011 do not cover road maintenance (at most it&#x27;s RI with almost 80% and median of about 45% [1]). Furthermore, the federal gas tax (which is supposed to pay for the interstate system) hasn&#x27;t been increased since 1993, and isn&#x27;t indexed to inflation. The United States Highway Trust Fund has been relying on non-fuel tax revenue since 2008, and that doesn&#x27;t look to be changing any time soon [2]. Of course, regardless of the actual costs of effective maintenance, you can make any public works project much cheaper by simply not maintaining it. If maintenance was actually &quot;extremely cheap,&quot; then it stands to reason that the US would be getting more than a &#x27;D&#x27; on roads [3]. Even after all of that, it still doesn&#x27;t factor in the legal requirements for private expenditure on roads, such as minimum parking requirements and extensive R1 zoning. It also doesn&#x27;t factor in the vast negative externalities of cars (yes, even electric cars).<p>&gt; Whereas rail is unbelievably expensive<p>I&#x27;m going to ignore that you chose the MTA, a famously corrupt organization that is responsible for tunneling under the densest metro area in the country, as a baseline for the cost of rail. Instead I&#x27;m going to point out that car roads have nearly every bureaucratic advantage in the US, for a multitude of reasons. There is a lot of nuance to this, but for anything short of HSR, the expense in railroads is not engineering.

Yea you can try to diversify but the average person doesn’t do this, they build something somewhere specific. These platforms are tremendously important, both for speech and for peoples livelihoods. Banning people and the appeals should be much more of a delicate process than currently. Right now these moderators are akin to police departments with no court system. One day we will enact laws that force companies of certain sizes to have an appeal process, or in some way dedicate resources to accurate appeals, or maybe just force companies to keep records of the ban and give users the right to sue for mistakes, similar to workers have for with employers. We almost need an entirely new public court system to manage that process so the burden isn’t on companies or users.

??<p>What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s almost certainly not the last word on that subject when you just compare empty homes to population as it&#x27;s also about the sheer, absolute scale of China&#x27;s literally cities—not scattered homes or towns—that are near 100% unoccupied. Also the figure for SF might be a bit out of proportion b&#x2F;c the city limits are just a slice of the Bay Area (1 out of 9 counties); from <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trendstatistics.com&#x2F;real-estate&#x2F;bay-area-vacant-property-statistics&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trendstatistics.com&#x2F;real-estate&#x2F;bay-area-vacant-...</a>:<p><pre><code>    1. San Francisco had 38,651 empty homes in 2018

    2. The Bay Area has over 46,000 vacant homes
</code></pre>
Now the Bay Area has a population of ~7.75 million people (Wikipedia), so San Francisco has only ~10% of the BA population, but the percentage of BA vacant homes located in SF is a staggering ~84%. None of these figures is terribly precise, but 46e3&#x2F;7750e3 is like ~0.6% (~half a vacant property per 100 people) for the entire Bay Area. Not sure what you calculated or whether it&#x27;s just too late over here for me to do maths, but I&#x27;m getting 38651&#x2F;860000 * 100 == 4.49 for San Francisco (4 and half vacant homes per 100 people), while for China I get 65e6&#x2F;1400e6 so ~4.64% (~5 vacant properties per 100 people), which is nearly the same when you compare the small-ish city to the huge country, and China having ten times as many vacant properties when compared to the Bay Area.<p>Lastly, the proper interpretation of the figures plays a role, too as discussed in <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;socketsite.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;there-are-not-40000-vacant-homes-in-san-francisco.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;socketsite.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;there-are-not-40000-...</a> which article points out that e.g. homes only used during the week but not on the week ends are listed as vacant.

Maybe my usage patterns could help you writing your app.<p>I tend to use the app to get a pulse on the nutrient density of the foods I consume (or feed my daughter). I would make simple meals, and plug them in, and then try to get all the nutrient bars filled up. It was harder than I expected. It was a puzzle to figure out because foods have different levels of each nutrient. I want to avoid adding onto nutrients I&#x27;m already consuming enough of.<p>I tried to use the Nutrients app to search for foods dense in some nutrient I was lacking, but I often found Google searches to be better for this. The way the app ranked foods wasn&#x27;t useful to me. Was it measuring nutrients by weight? What if I wanted to rank by price, or by region? I don&#x27;t care that raw Moose Liver has lots of Riboflavin.<p>I preferred using the app to determine my grocery list because I don&#x27;t like recipes. I want to know how to cook things individually (pasta, rice, eggs, asparagus, etc) with salt + (butter or oil), and then figure out how to assemble meals on my own. With recipes, I would often have leftovers I didn&#x27;t know what to do with. I could look up more recipes, but I couldn&#x27;t see how this would make me a better cook since I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing or why. I was inspired by Samin Nosrat&#x27;s Salt Fat Acid Heat approach to cooking. This way I could get nutrition and flavor simultaneously.<p>This all got really complicated, and I eventually figured I wouldn&#x27;t reach the end of it. For example, rice grown in different regions has different levels of arsenic. I&#x27;m not concerned about arsenic specifically, but the finding got me more curiously interested in toxins, and soil differences around the world. I got into nutrition thinking I could be convinced of one specific diet over another, but I soon found myself looking into differences between soil in different regions.<p>After I used the app enough, I got a sense of some of my blind spots, and used that to adjust my diet intuitively.<p>Some changes that more-or-less stuck:
- More sun for Vitamin D
- More Avocados
- Omega-3 from fish oil
- Nutritional Yeast for B Vitamins
- More greens (especially for magnesium)
- Spinach in smoothies
- Less sugars, carbs, and bread
- Parmesan cheese for calcium
- More beans<p>I have decent intuition around green means chlorophyll molecule means there&#x27;s a magnesium atom in there, and some others. The minerals are easy enough for me to get enough of. I can usually get enough Vitamin C. I don&#x27;t have good intuition around Vitamin K, E, Niacin, Riboflavin, Folate. Beans have lots of Folate. This makes sense, but lots of other foods I regularly eat have it too.<p>I&#x27;m inspired to get back into this and start tracking again.<p>--<p>BACKGROUND:<p>After my daughter was born, I was suddenly extremely interested in nutrition. I worried what might happen if my daughter started missing important nutrients. However, it was hard to get trustworthy information on nutrition. Important debates weren&#x27;t settled. I wasn&#x27;t confident that I could trust things like the food pyramid. Like you, I felt more confident about using micro and macro nutrients as a way to decide what to eat, but also to compose meals that were nutritionally complete. This is something I didn&#x27;t see much focus on. People would tout some specific food as &quot;healthy&quot; without putting it in context.<p>From there, I still wanted to cover my bases for unknown unknowns. If I added more traditional foods, I&#x27;d be able to cover for it. As an outsider, I don&#x27;t know how likely it is that we&#x27;ve discovered all the nutrients we need. For example, I recently saw a research paper asking if Lithium is a micronutrient. Maybe there were foods that had nutrients that weren&#x27;t discovered, or maybe different people need different levels of the same nutrients. Maybe microplastics are a bigger problem than we imagine. It&#x27;s hard to account for everything. I wanted a baseline I could start from. I looked into traditional slavic foods. I found that potatoes were more recents, for example, so I wouldn&#x27;t use them to cover for unknown unknowns. However, cabbage and buckwheat are both nutritionally rich and slavic staples. Maybe I could use this finding to trust dishes that feature these ingredients.",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Earth has about 5.1 x 10^8 km^2, so say 2.5 x 10^14 sq. meters.<p>* Radiators for the waste heat would be dumping 10^23 W &#x2F; 2.5 x 10^14 m^2 = 4 x 10^8 watts per square meter. That&#x27;s 400 megawatts. Per square meter.<p>* That&#x27;s a black-body temperature of 9,165 K (the Sun&#x27;s surface is 5,772 K). Peak wavelength is 316 nm. So half the Earth&#x27;s surface is a glowing UV light pointed at the sky. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d have to worry about the ozone layer disappearing. (A very bright, inefficient UV lamp--plenty of infrared, hard UV, and soft X-rays to go around!)<p>* OK, so put the power plants in geostationary orbit. Say 1 million power stations, each with radiators 1 square kilometer.<p>* 1e6 stations * 1e9 square meters = 1e15 sq meters.<p>* So, that&#x27;s only 1e8 watts&#x2F;meter! Hmm. Still 6,480 K, but peak is blue-violet rather than UV. Still lots of UV and infrared, but it&#x27;s space, who cares. Just don&#x27;t cross the beams (ha ha, meaning no deep-space traffic). And mind the Moon! (Wouldn&#x27;t want to give anbody on earth a reflected sunburn).<p>* The radiation pressure from the waste engery for one power stations would be about 730 kN (160,000 pounds). Would need counter-balanced beams.<p>* Geostationary orbit is about 26,000 miles. The surface area of a sphere that big is 2e16 square meters. So about 1&#x2F;20th of the sky would be covered with powerplant radiators.<p><i>And this is just for the hypothetical 0.1% waste energy.</i> Multiply all of the above by 1,000 for the actual used energy. So you&#x27;d have half the Earth&#x27;s surface as power receivers slurping up 400 gigawatts&#x2F;square meter of X-rays and hard UV. Each power station would see a force of 739 mega-newtons; you&#x27;d have to have a counter-balancing beam pointing away from Earth. And <i>then</i> you&#x27;d need to radiate away all that energy after it was used.<p>Edit: Oh, and while 1&#x2F;2 of the Earth is receiving 400 GW&#x2F;m^2, the other half is <i>using</i> that amount.

This is something I wish more people understood. Two different things are never the same thing. You can come up with similarities based on arbitrary criteria, and that&#x27;s all.<p>For example, what we consider make two different person a woman is arbitrary criteria that we just all agree on, or debate forever.<p>&gt; How many people are dropping dead from it? It doesn&#x27;t seem like an arbitrary distinction to me<p>You want to engage in that &quot;forever debate of semantics&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s your point.<p>Currently, it&#x27;s agreed on taxonomy that chickenpox is not on the same family as monkeypox and smallpox. That&#x27;s just agreed upon arbitrary categories.<p>Now the arbitrary doesn&#x27;t mean useless. Often categories are chosen based on some practical aspect. For example it helps to group them if they have a similar behavior in some way that is often helpful to group in the default case.<p>An example of this is how in culinary science, a Tomato is made a Vegetable, because it&#x27;s more useful to club vegetables around their flavor profile. You most of the time don&#x27;t want to use a Tomato for a recipe that calls for fruits. But in botanical science, flavor isn&#x27;t useful, it&#x27;s more useful to think in terms of what contain seeds, thus a Tomato is made a fruit.<p>Each science uses their own arbitrary classification based on what is more practically useful for their line of research.<p>Ok, so I think your point isn&#x27;t to try and tell virologists that their chosen taxonomy isn&#x27;t as optimal for their line of research. But that in the case of public policy and messaging, virulence might be more important.<p>Even though both virus are of the same family, there is still a major difference in their virulence. And maybe that property holds more weight in this case.<p>I think that&#x27;s a great point, but that you were arguing wrong by attacking the definition instead of bringing up the characteristic of importance and explaining why.<p>Now this is as much as I know of virology, so I can&#x27;t say if there are good reasons to be worried about the chances of virulence changing because they are in the same family or not. But I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re right, virulence is what the public cares about, and it be nicer for virologist to explain the chances of the virulence getting worse through some mutations and if they think it&#x27;s high, why, or if they think it&#x27;s low, why.",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

However it&#x27;s much more difficult to find a great, satisfying job. For that you need to navigate around a lot of corpo-bullshit type of projects, and Clojure has served me well as a useful filter in doing that.
My reasoning is that Clojure is niche enough that when company is using it, you can assume that it&#x27;s due to a deliberate technical choice, and not just because of its popularity. That tells me two things that are symptomatic, in my opinion, of a healthy tech company culture:
- tech decisions are made by engineers, not by top-level executives,
- their conclusions and bets align with mine because we all see and agree on Clojure&#x27;s edge over more popular solutions.<p>Admittedly, there&#x27;s always a risk that someone just followed the hype and got out of their depth but I think this risk is relatively small, because Clojure&#x27;s no longer a new kid on a block and choosing a tech stack is a major decision and usually done by senior tech leadership, hopefully less hype driven.<p>Of course, Clojure is no silver bullet and it&#x27;s just a tool that gives you enough rope to hang yourself. Messy codebases are just as possible as in other languages, especially when the team is new to lisps that are very different from mainstream languages, but that&#x27;s a nature of software development - you learn with the experience. I do cringe when I look at the Clojure code I wrote when I was just starting and wasn&#x27;t fully grasping Clojure&#x27;s way of thinking, but the more I use it, the more I come to appreciate how powerful it is.<p>Great intro that made it click for me: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vK1DazRK_a0"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vK1DazRK_a0</a> (Solving Problems the Clojure Way - Rafal Dittwald, 2019)<p>Having said that, no software project is ever complete and so isn&#x27;t Clojure as an ecosystem. The tooling is constantly evolving and new patterns are emerging. What&#x27;s great about Clojure open-source community is that everyone seems to share the desire to harness complexity and Rich Hickey has convinced each one of us at some point that the way to do it is through simplicity <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;Simple-Made-Easy&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;Simple-Made-Easy&#x2F;</a><p>Even within Clojure&#x27;s community there&#x27;s a diversity of approaches, and I think it&#x27;s necessary to improve and evolve. The more recent trend, I&#x27;ve noticed is that the community is converging at Data Oriented Programming that&#x27;s applicable in other languages as well, but has always been at the core of Clojure&#x27;s mindset that is especially well suited for it.<p>Dropping some links relevant about DOP:

And also engine makers, not all of them have the time and resources to do an editor like Unity or Unreal.<p>A good generic editor is better than a shitty specific editor. It&#x27;s also better than a non-existing editor.<p><i>&gt; It&#x27;s the same thing with IDE.  The more plugin friendly you make your IDE, the less optimization chances you have.</i><p>Visual Studio Code, vim and emacs are actually extremely extensible and very performant.

Most of their services are written in PHP which I haven&#x27;t used since the early 2000s. I wouldn&#x27;t classify myself as a PHP developer. Sometimes I find myself diving into the code to self-solve issues I have that are infrastructure related. My thought process is if I can solve a problem and it&#x27;s within my scope of things to do I&#x27;d much rather just do it than add extra work to another developer on the team. In the worst case scenario someone with actual PHP experience who does the code review will offer suggestions to make the code better.<p>I don&#x27;t really know PHP but I can look around and navigate the code without issues. There&#x27;s nothing that looks too foreign and the code is easy to grep to find stuff. It&#x27;s also not too bad to trace code in a large app and understand the logic. There&#x27;s also a massive amount of Google results for almost any problem you can think of. It really means for a lot of cases you can combine previous experience and be productive in a similar language without really knowing it. Enough to contribute real code that gets shipped to production.<p>I ended up doing this yesterday where I added an IP whitelist address exempt config option to one of our apps. I wanted to at least toy with the idea of doing IP range detection within a CIDR block.<p>In Python this is really easy, the standard library has functions to do this with 1 line of code. Ruby&#x27;s implementation is even easier and built into the language. For PHP I had to Google around but found a pretty small custom function to use in less than 2 minutes. For Elixir? Well you have to use a 4 year old+ third party dependency or dive down into Erlang and understand pattern matching and write a bunch of code to manually do the comparisons. Maybe there&#x27;s a good Elixir solution but it wasn&#x27;t on the first 3 pages of Google when searching for similar terms as I did for Python, Ruby and PHP. Weirdly enough if you search for &quot;elixir check if ip address is in cidr block range&quot; most of the top results are StackOverflow posts for other languages. There&#x27;s no contest in comparing the amount of effort it took to get a solution.<p>I know this is 1 just example but I also know when I tried learning Elixir (and did end up writing about 10k lines of code of it) I kept running into situations that took half a day or longer to figure out while actively trying hard to learn and use the language. These problem could be fully solved in a production ready way in 5-10 minutes with Python or Ruby (and I guess PHP too) either by knowing how to solve it in an imperative way or finding nearly a perfect solution when Googling that&#x27;s digestible enough to where you can fully understand it and apply it back to your problem.",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

It&#x27;s pretty easy to get pissed off at these companies when this happens. These companies are growth-obsessed and the ostensible philosophy is always &quot;making the world a better place&quot;.

I never thought about marketing this way before. So I want to share some takeaways around defining your niche &amp; target audience that inspired me after reading this.
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.developermarkepear.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;paid-advertising-developer-marketing"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.developermarkepear.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;paid-advertising-dev...</a><p>Rather than looking for new audiences, I am looking for people that already show interest in the type of problem I want to solve, and learning from them.  That means that I am currently focusing on understanding who the target audience is, and understanding their problems so that I can do a bit of pre-validation &amp; prioritization of features to build steadily.<p>Steps:<p>1. Define who the target audience is? What is their role or job title? 
 - I want to build a product for (job title) saas&#x2F;ecommerce company founders who already value pleasant &amp; snappy end-user experiences.
 - I’d prefer to work with saas&#x2F;product founders partly because they have a shorter sales cycles than large companies, and mostly because they are simply more interesting to talk to than people working for large&#x2F;established companies.<p>2. Where does my target audience post&#x2F;communicate?
 - Look where the target audience posts so you can talk to them, and eventually sell to them. For example: I am looking for places where saas&#x2F;ecommerce company founders post such as Product hunt, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;saas"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;saas</a> because it is community of people who build products. That’s exactly the type of person I want to work with.<p>- Another idea is to google &amp; discover who wants&#x2F;already shows interest in the problem you are trying to solve. For me, it is figuring out where do people who care about snappy &amp; performant websites congregate online?  Which website, subreddit, or hashtag did this discussion take place in?<p>3. After finding where, understand the type of content you should post:
What’s your goal with posting content? Do you want views&#x2F;signups or credit card #s?
Measure &amp; understand if you are on the right track&#x2F;making progress. If you link to your product in your profile or in a post, how can you know when you are on the right track.  I am going to measure views, bounces, and conversions. Conversions could be things like email addresses, or credit cards.
- Look at similar companies to yours, who is their founder? Did they post or comment more as they built up their audience?<p>4. TBD: After I gather more insights on who is interested in website performance, I want to know why they care about this, so that I can make sure my product solves their problems in the fastest &amp; most intuitive &amp; reliable way.<p>Would LOVE to hear from saas founders here, and see how they approached this.",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Now having a simple compiler with all these features may be impossible, so worse-case there is just a simple interpreter, a separate type-checker, and a separate performance-optimized JIT compiler (like Lua and LuaJIT).<p>Also like Lua and high-level assembly, debugging unoptimized is also really simple and direct. By default, there aren’t optimizations which elide variables, move instructions around, and otherwise clobber the data so the debugger loses information, not even tail-call optimization. Execution is so simple someone will create a reliable record-replay, time-travel debugger which is fast enough you could run it in production, and we can have true in-depth debugging.<p>Now that i’ve wrote all that I realize this is basically ML.

It&#x27;s prpjected to take 19 years since approval and 10 years since construction began and cost 26 billion pounds for a nameplate 3200MW capacity. Taking the ratio between nameplate and net for its predecessor of about 62%, we can expect around 11.8 pounds per watt. This does not include operating costs or the decommissioning when the taxpayer gets left holding the ball, or any of the other hidden costs such as the externalised costs of security and publicly funded administration overhead. Nuclear has a zero or even negative economic learning rate so there is no reason to believe any additional plants will be cheaper.<p>You personally can go buy a 1kW net system for less money per watt right now. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HxUgX3MLWYI"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HxUgX3MLWYI</a><p>It will pay itself off before any nuclear project started now even opens.

Put 5kW of nameplate wind capacity into a copy of the same storage system and you have another 2kW average with lower price and even less downtime.<p>A hydrogen electrolyzer you can purchase right now costs $1000&#x2F;kW, a 1kW fuel cell is around $4000 and low pressure hydrogen tanks are on the order of $20&#x2F;kWh.

Looks like the conversion efficiency is 4% but 20% is expected after recycling heat and catalyst improvements.<p>I find stuff like this simultaneously inspiring and devastating. The technology has arrived to easily create our own electricity and fuel without having to deal with supply chain issues around centralized photovoltaic manufacturers, yet the size of the challenge is insurmountable. There is simply no way to scale this big enough to save the natural world before global warming destroys it at the end of the century.<p>So, that leaves us with nuclear power (fission). I appreciate that a lot of people have worked very hard on it and have humanity&#x27;s best interests at heart. But they don&#x27;t understand human psychology. We all know that we&#x27;ve been lied to about the safety of nuclear power, but they pretend that it can be made safe.

Which is still a big problem, but it&#x27;s smaller than paying off a mortgage.<p>So everyone&#x27;s gotta wake up, forget they got hoodwinked, stop listening to the wealthy and powerful people talking us out of this, and just start doing it. Be a real conservative, lead by example. Be a real liberal, pay it forward. Mourn the breakdown of our institutions that set this back 40 years.

However usually these situations come from a lack of time for the board&#x2F;high-energy-members to participate in the needed fundraising activities. Our space is organized by 100% volunteer effort, I&#x27;m guessing there is a similar situation for Hacker Lab (or else this is a fundraising tactic itself, it&#x27;s been done before by other spaces). In the beginning we had the energy to get a lot of stuff done, but that energy gets consumed by inertia and overhead of keeping a space running once it becomes &quot;successful&quot;. Until a space becomes large enough to have a paid board of directors in some form it seems the energy of the board glides downwards over time. However without the overhead of a paid board a space can glide for years on thin margins. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s almost a catch-22.<p>I don&#x27;t agree the government should just hand out indefinite free money for these spaces to operate though because it would also kill them in due time.

Discussions with GNOME devs seems not to lead anywhere. Here³&#x27;s the opionion of a Pop!_OS maintainer:<p><pre><code>  Something @GNOME NEEDS to realize is that Pop!_OS, Ubuntu, and others are NOT
  going to stop theming. What we will do instead is replace GNOME components
  entirely if it becomes too costly to apply our style to them. Come up with a
  way forward for custom styles, or lose users.
</code></pre>
The theming problem has been very much discussed - if with &quot;discussing&quot;, you mean lots of users (devs) talking to a wall. It&#x27;s worse actually; the GNOME team actively prevented devs from developing theming, and advocated against it.<p>I actually had a link where a GNOME dev was urging Debian (or Ubuntu, can&#x27;t remember) to revert a patch that restored terminal transparency (or something like that). Could you help me finding it?<p>Here&#x27;s an interesting reply from Christian Persch²:<p><pre><code>  &gt; 1. Open gnome terminal
  &gt; 2. Go to Edit -&gt; Profile Preferences
  &gt; Actual result: Background configuration tab is missing.
  &gt; It was present in 3.6 version, please return it back.
  No.

But what if the simpler, more obvious answer, was true: that cats are actually fairly stupid and have a limited repertoire of interaction protocols and their hard to get act is not an act. Nothing happenin&#x27; as far as kitty is concerned. A dog, in contrast, has interaction smarts. And I thought this is just like AI and projecting sentience. A lack of something is misunderstood as a surplus of something else: smarts. Cats playing hard to get, psychological savvy, training their human servants, etc. Whereas in reality, the cat simply didn&#x27;t recognize something else was attempting initiating an interaction. Kitty has no clue, that&#x27;s all. It&#x27;s just so easy to project psychological state on objects. We do it with our cars, for god&#x27;s sake.

With inference from return, to figure out what foo(bar)&#x27;s type is, I need to <i>read the implementation of foo</i> because I have to find out what the return statements look like.

SSD is faster: but you can design your architecture so that this mostly doesn’t matter, and even a “slow” HDD will be running at capacity. (The trick is to do linear streaming as much as possible, and avoid seeks at all costs.) Still, it’s probably a good idea to store your production index on an SSD, and it’s useful for intermediate data as well; by happenstance more than design I have a large HDD and a small SSD and they balance each other nicely.<p>Storing files: 100% agree with this section, for the disk-seek reasons I mention above. Also, pages from the same website often compress very well against each other (since they’re using the same templates, large chunks of HTML can be squished down considerably), so if you’re pressed for space consider storing one GZIPped file per domain. (The tradeoff with zipping is that you can’t arbitrarily seek, but ideally you’ve designed things so you don’t need to do that anyway.) Also, WARC is a standard file format that has a lot of tooling for this exact use case.<p>Networking: I skipped this by just storing everything on one computer; I expect to be able to continue doing this for a long time, since vertical scaling can get you <i>very</i> far these days.<p>Indexing: You basically don’t need to write <i>anything</i> to get started with this these days! I’m just using bog-standard Elasticsearch with some glue code to do html2text; it’s working fine and took all of an afternoon to set up from scratch. (That said, I’m not sure I’ll <i>continue</i> using Elastic: it has a ton of features I don’t need, which makes it very hard to understand and work with since there’s so much that’s irrelevant to me. I’m probably going to switch to either straight Lucene or Bleve soon.)<p>Page rank: I added pagerank very early on in the hopes that it would improve my results, and I’m not really sure how helpful it is if your results aren’t decent to begin with. However, the march of Moore’s law has made it an easy experiment: what Page and Brin’s server could compute in a week with carefully optimized C code, mine can do in less than 5 minutes (!) with a bit of JavaScript.<p>Serving: Again, ElasticSearch will solve this entire problem for you (at least to start with); all your frontend has to do is take the JSON result and poke it into an HTML template.<p>It’s easier than ever to start building a search engine in your own home; the recent explosion of such services (as seen on HN) is an indicator of the feasibility, and the rising complaints about Google show that the demand is there.

For more than a decade, the people charged with the maintenance of that machine were allowed to tinker with it according to their whims and idiosyncratic tastes. The result of all that tinkering was a machine which, for all its apparent wonkiness, worked brilliantly. 

  The problem with a machine like that is that it’s difficult for anyone who didn’t build it, or doesn’t respect those who did, to understand exactly how or why it works. When Deadspin’s staffers and readers looked at the machine, they saw a wonderful and whirring contraption, but all Spanfeller and Great Hill saw was an odd collection of valves and pistons. They saw parts, but not the whole. 

  Spanfeller’s disdain for his own newsroom, the “stick to sports” memo, Petchesky being fired, and the cascade of oppressive ads—they were all signaling the same thing: Spanfeller and Great Hill weren’t really interested in preserving what we had spent the last decade building. Maybe a few components would remain to keep up appearances, but Deadspin’s demolition was coming, and we couldn’t stop it. What we could do was refuse to participate in its destruction.</code></pre>",comment,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

Never hit the old speeds. You&#x27;re right about the right hand bias, though. I traded my left hand pain from qwerty for worse right hand pain with dvorak. It lasted even after building an ergonomic keyboard, so I switched to the workman layout after that. Things are basically fine now. Workman actually does promise 50&#x2F;50 hand usage, which is rather unique and not seen in other layouts, whether more or less efficient. This criterion made me choose it over the more extreme halmak layout. Also, I like the name &quot;workman&quot; and that the left side homerow spells &quot;ash&quot;.<p>I never liked the idea of colemak being intentionally similar to qwerty and changing up fewer keys than dvorak. I thought this idea was limiting and gave people the easy way out. Workman applies a similar idea, which again annoyed me at first, but I&#x27;m pretty used to it now. I&#x27;d say it makes it more confusing to type qwerty on another keyboard as some keys are the same and muscle memory can get mixed up between the two. I don&#x27;t type qwerty much at all, so maybe this would improve over time. With dvorak I think only a and m were the same for the letters, so it felt more like hitting a distinct switch.<p>Workman also avoids the issue in colemak that colemak mod-dh had to fix from what I understand. Of course these layouts are not all the same age, so one might learn their layout and become loyal to it before a better one is invented. Dvorak is quite old now, and colemak is at least older than workman.<p>I no longer remember dvorak at all. I think I used it for 18-24 months or so. I&#x27;ll probably remember qwerty forever since I grew up on it, and I use workman daily so it&#x27;s safe for now.

But, Ag schools, at least in the US, have been promoting using herbicides like glyphosate and Reglone to desiccate crops immediately prior to harvest[1] to avoid having to mow the crops to get a low uniform crop moisture content for harvesting equipment.
