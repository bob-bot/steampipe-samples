This must have been tried before, but I can&#x27;t find a lot of examples:<p>A matching&#x2F;partnering service for intellectuals, or people with those interests. For example, let&#x27;s say I want to read a big&#x2F;hard&#x2F;long book, on any topic, with someone else. I could create a pitch for some reading project or course of study: create a post where I discuss what I want to get out of it, disclose any prior knowledge or training, etc..--then let anyone who&#x27;s interested propose to read&#x2F;study&#x2F;research with me.<p>I know book clubs are a thing. I found https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bookworm.club, a reader matching service posted here[1] less than a year ago, but what I am thinking about is a little different. It would be broader matchmaking service than just book reading, applicable to any project involving committed study or research. Maybe I&#x27;m good at math, and I&#x27;m looking for someone who&#x27;s interested in doing a self-guided intro to quantum mechanics. Or I&#x27;m interested in learning more about early US colonial history, and I want someone to help me pick the five most important books on King Philip&#x27;s War to skim and synthesize. Or I have an idea for a robotics hobby project, and I want to find someone with a technical background that&#x27;s complementary to my own. Or I&#x27;ve always gotten stuck on the fourth book of Proust&#x27;s <i>In Search of Lost Time</i>, and I want to find someone to go through it with me and discuss every two weeks. Anything--you define the terms.<p>I know formal classes and education are an approximate solution here, but I think that a person&#x27;s commitment and interest are often higher in cases of self-study, because your motivation comes from being clear with yourself about what you want to get out of your efforts. Self-studiers are a special group. There are also a lot more niche interests than formal classes.<p>My guess is there are actually a good number of smart people who want to do these things, but they give up because the chance of finding a suitable partner is low. The people with the same interests are often irregularly distributed. and feel isolated. A service that would work at internet scale, especially with more people willing to do this over Zoom, would help to match a lot of these ardent intellectual loners on the long tail of interests.<p>My initial sense is that a good match between prospective partners would be hard to discern algorithmically, since so much about intellectual fit depends on the nuances of what they want to do. So the actual matching would involve pitching, conversation back and forth, negotiation, etc.<p>Anyways, can someone point me to previous efforts in this area? General thoughts are of course welcome too.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29230283",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

And, if my understanding of the protections of the act are incorrect, and it does not, in fact, prevent continued retention and selling of personal data after a CCPA request has been lodged (i.e., it contains giant loopholes that negate any real protection by the act).<p>At the end of February, I visited a government site that asked me security questions that I had not provided answers to.  My account was locked because I answered the questions &quot;wrong&quot;.  The site&#x27;s support responded, to a query, that they sourced the questions and answers from LexisNexis.<p>I wanted to avoid such issues in the future, so using the LexisNexis CCPA request web form, I checked the boxes on all three of, request a) a copy of the data they had collected, b) they not sell my data, and c) they delete the data they already had collected.  In early March, I got confirmation of my request and an extensive report of the data they had collected on me.<p>The data was extremely unreliable containing many errors.  It was no wonder I could not answer the security questions &quot;correctly&quot;.<p>In mid July, I had to use that government web site again, and was again prompted with security questions I had not provided answers for (this time, however, I was able to answer the questions &quot;correctly&quot; using the CCPA report as an answer key).  I contacted the site again, and they confirmed that the questions and answers were exclusively sourced from LexisNexis, and that they did not cache &#x2F; store any of this information-- that the website queries LexisNexis in real time at the time the questions are posed to the visitor.<p>This seems to indicate that LexisNexis did not, in fact delete my data, and Lexis Nexis is continuing to sell my data.<p>If you have placed CCPA requests, what have been your experiences?  And, were my expectations that the CCPA would prevent LexisNexis from continuing to retain and sell my data not in line with what the CCPA actually provides?",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"

The algorithms work, and while some are public, they are mostly only exposed via recent research papers with no public implementation&#x2F;trained models. All questions aside to whether that is true, I developed the platform to support ten or so startup ideas. Probably some will not work. The idea is then to set up new startups for each idea, find a non technical cofounder, and give them significant equity in that particular business vertical.<p>So from a legal perspective, the IP sits in a separate company, which bills the consuming company for the compute, and the startup sits in a separate entity, from which the non technical founder has equity.<p>Is this common? Are there other ways to think about it?<p>Obviously should talk to a lawyer, and yes I know ideas are cheap, but here I have already reached 90% of the technical implementation for each idea. Other caveats, I am aware startups are hard, most fail, I should focus on one, etc.",story,<null>,"{""connection_name"":""hackernews""}"
