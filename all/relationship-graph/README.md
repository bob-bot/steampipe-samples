# Graphs, Nodes, Edges, HCL-level With

These examples require:

- Steampipe v0.18 or higher.

- The [Steampipe](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/steampipe) plugin (`steampipe plugin install steampipe`).

The examples use two of the plugin's tables -- `steampipe_registry_plugin` and `steampipe_registry_plugin_version` -- to demo graph, node, edge, and with idioms useful to mod authors building relationship graphs.
